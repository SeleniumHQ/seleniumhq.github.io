	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.\nTerminology  API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of \u0026ldquo;commands\u0026rdquo; you use to manipulate WebDriver. Library: A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc. Driver: Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not on the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies. Framework: An additional library used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for things such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.  The Parts and Pieces At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and receives information back via the same route.\nThe driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google\u0026rsquo;s Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may, or may not be, the same system where the tests themselves are executing.\nThis simple example above is direct communication. Communication to the browser may also be remote communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.\nRemote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system\nWhere Frameworks fit in WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about testing: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.\nThis is where various frameworks come in to play. At a minimum you\u0026rsquo;ll need a test framework that matches the language bindings, eg NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.\nThe test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.\nNatural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their own implementation.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n First you need to install the Selenium bindings for your automation project. The installation process for libraries depends on the language you choose to use.\nJava Installation of Selenium libraries for Java can be done using Maven. Add the selenium-java dependency in your project pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-java\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; The selenium-java dependency supports running your automation project with all Selenium supported browsers. If you want to run tests only in a specific browser, you can add the dependency for that browser in your pom.xml file. For example, you should add following dependency in your pom.xml file to run your tests only in Firefox:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-firefox-driver\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; In a similar manner, if you want to run tests only in Chrome, you should add the following dependency:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-chrome-driver\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Python Installation of Selenium libraries for Python can be done using pip:\npip install selenium Alternatively you can download the PyPI source archive (selenium-x.x.x.tar.gz) and install it using setup.py:\npython setup.py install C# Installation of Selenium libraries for C# can be done using NuGet:\n# Using package manager Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver # or using .Net CLI dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver Ruby Installation of Selenium libraries for Ruby can be done using gem:\ngem install selenium-webdriver JavaScript Installation of Selenium libraries for JavaScript can be done using npm:\nnpm install selenium-webdriver"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Selenium controls web browsers Selenium is many things, but at its core it\u0026rsquo;s a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser.\nIt allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.\nAlthough used primarily for front-end testing of websites, Selenium is at its core a browser user agent library. The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application, which encourages composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.\nOne interface to rule them all One of the project\u0026rsquo;s guiding principles is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies. Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications, performing their operations in completely different ways but which frequently look the same while doing so. Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts, the images are displayed in the same place and the links take you to the same destination. What is happening underneath is as different as night and day. Selenium “abstracts” these differences, hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code. This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow, but these same lines will execute on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.\nTools and support Selenium\u0026rsquo;s minimalist design approach gives it versatility to be included as a component in bigger applications. The surrounding infrastructure provided under the Selenium umbrella gives you the tools to put together your own grid of browsers so tests can be run on different browsers and multiple operating systems across a range of machines.\nImagine a bank of computers in your server room or data centre all firing up browsers at the same time hitting your site\u0026rsquo;s links, forms, and tables\u0026mdash;testing your application 24 hours a day. Through the simple programming interface provided for the most common languages, these tests will run tirelessly in parallel, reporting back to you when errors occur.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an aim to help make this a reality for you, by providing users with tools and documentation to not only control browsers, but to make it easy to scale and deploy such grids.\nWho uses Selenium Many of the most important companies in the world have adopted Selenium for their browser-based testing, often replacing years-long efforts involving other proprietary tools. As it has grown in popularity, so have its requirements and challenges multiplied.\nAs the web becomes more complicated and new technologies are added to websites, it\u0026rsquo;s the mission of this project to keep up with them where possible. Being an open source project, this support is provided through the generous donation of time from many volunteers, every one of which has a “day job”.\nAnother mission of the project is to encourage more volunteers to partake in this effort, and build a strong community so that the project can continue to keep up with emerging technologies and remain a dominant platform for functional test automation.\nHistory When Selenium 1 was released in 2004, it was out of the necessity to reduce time spent manually verifying consistent behaviour in the front-end of a web application. It made use of what tools were available at the time, and relied heavily on the injection of JavaScript to the web page under test to emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction.\nWhilst JavaScript is a good tool to let you introspect the properties of the DOM and to do certain client-side observations that you would otherwise not be able to do, it falls short on the ability to naturally replicate a user\u0026rsquo;s interactions as if the mouse and keyboard are being used.\nSince then, Selenium has grown and matured a lot, into a tool widely used by many\u0026mdash;if not most\u0026mdash;of the largest organisations around the world. Selenium has gone from a homebrewed test automation toolkit developed at Thoughtworks for a niché audience and a specific use case, to the world\u0026rsquo;s de facto browser automation library.\nJust as Selenium RC made use of the tools of the trade available at the time, Selenium WebDriver drives that tradition on by taking the browser interaction part to the browser vendor\u0026rsquo;s home turf, and asking them to take responsibility of the backend, browser-facing implementations. Recently this work has evolved into a W3C standardisation process where the goal is to turn the WebDriver component in Selenium into the du jeur remote control library for user agents.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to test. The server can be used either from the command line or through code configuration.\nStarting the server from the command line Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar, place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from the directory with the jar, run the following:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar Considerations for running the server The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.\nThe selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session, which are cleared when Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit is called. If you forget to terminate these sessions, your server may leak memory. If you keep extremely long-running sessions, you will probably need to stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option).\nTimeouts (from version 2.21) The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60  browserTimeout  Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds).  timeout  Controls how long the client is allowed to be gone before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds).   The system property selenium.server.session.timeout is no longer supported as of 2.21.\nPlease note that the browserTimeout is intended as a backup timeout mechanism when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails, which should be used mostly in grid/server environments to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long, polluting the runtime environment.\nConfiguring the server programmatically In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the DriverServlet to a URL, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to host the page in a lightweight container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this follow.\nDownload the selenium-server.zip and unpack. Put the JARs on the CLASSPATH. Create a new class called AppServer. Here, I\u0026rsquo;m using Jetty, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download that as well:\nimport org.mortbay.jetty.Connector; import org.mortbay.jetty.Server; import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext; import javax.servlet.Servlet; import java.io.File; import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet; public class AppServer { private Server server = new Server(); public AppServer() throws Exception { WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext(); context.setContextPath(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); context.setWar(new File(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)); server.addHandler(context); context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, \u0026#34;/wd/*\u0026#34;); SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector(); connector.setPort(3001); server.addConnector(connector); server.start(); } }"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT*. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with that page of the UI. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves do not need to change; only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.\nThe Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantage: there is clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if you are using a UI map) and layout.\nPage object methods should return a value  If you submit a page and are redirected, it should return the new page object. If you click submit on login and you want to check to see if a user is logged in, it should return True or False in a method.   *AUT: Application under test\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Introduction Selenium RC was the main Selenium project for a long time, before the WebDriver/Selenium merge brought up Selenium 2, a more powerful tool. It is worth to highlight that Selenium 1 is not supported anymore.\nHow Selenium RC Works First, we will describe how the components of Selenium RC operate and the role each plays in running your test scripts.\nRC Components Selenium RC components are:\n The Selenium Server which launches and kills browsers, interprets and runs the Selenese commands passed from the test program, and acts as an HTTP proxy, intercepting and verifying HTTP messages passed between the browser and the AUT. Client libraries which provide the interface between each programming language and the Selenium RC Server.  Here is a simplified architecture diagram:\nThe diagram shows the client libraries communicate with the Server passing each Selenium command for execution. Then the server passes the Selenium command to the browser using Selenium-Core JavaScript commands. The browser, using its JavaScript interpreter, executes the Selenium command. This runs the Selenese action or verification you specified in your test script.\nSelenium Server Selenium Server receives Selenium commands from your test program, interprets them, and reports back to your program the results of running those tests.\nThe RC server bundles Selenium Core and automatically injects it into the browser. This occurs when your test program opens the browser (using a client library API function). Selenium-Core is a JavaScript program, actually a set of JavaScript functions which interprets and executes Selenese commands using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in JavaScript interpreter.\nThe Server receives the Selenese commands from your test program using simple HTTP GET/POST requests. This means you can use any programming language that can send HTTP requests to automate Selenium tests on the browser.\nClient Libraries The client libraries provide the programming support that allows you to run Selenium commands from a program of your own design. There is a different client library for each supported language. A Selenium client library provides a programming interface (API), i.e., a set of functions, which run Selenium commands from your own program. Within each interface, there is a programming function that supports each Selenese command.\nThe client library takes a Selenese command and passes it to the Selenium Server for processing a specific action or test against the application under test (AUT). The client library also receives the result of that command and passes it back to your program. Your program can receive the result and store it into a program variable and report it as a success or failure, or possibly take corrective action if it was an unexpected error.\nSo to create a test program, you simply write a program that runs a set of Selenium commands using a client library API. And, optionally, if you already have a Selenese test script created in the Selenium-IDE, you can generate the Selenium RC code. The Selenium-IDE can translate (using its Export menu item) its Selenium commands into a client-driver\u0026rsquo;s API function calls. See the Selenium-IDE chapter for specifics on exporting RC code from Selenium-IDE.\nInstallation Installation is rather a misnomer for Selenium. Selenium has a set of libraries available in the programming language of your choice. You could download them from the downloads page.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen a language to work with, you simply need to:\n Install the Selenium RC Server. Set up a programming project using a language specific client driver.  Installing Selenium Server The Selenium RC server is simply a Java jar file (selenium-server-standalone-.jar), which doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any special installation. Just downloading the zip file and extracting the server in the desired directory is sufficient.\nRunning Selenium Server Before starting any tests you must start the server. Go to the directory where Selenium RC\u0026rsquo;s server is located and run the following from a command-line console.\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar This can be simplified by creating a batch or shell executable file (.bat on Windows and .sh on Linux) containing the command above. Then make a shortcut to that executable on your desktop and simply double-click the icon to start the server.\nFor the server to run you\u0026rsquo;ll need Java installed and the PATH environment variable correctly configured to run it from the console. You can check that you have Java correctly installed by running the following on a console.\njava -version If you get a version number (which needs to be 1.5 or later), you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start using Selenium RC.\nUsing the Java Client Driver  Download Selenium java client driver zip from the SeleniumHQ downloads page. Extract selenium-java-.jar file Open your desired Java IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, Netweaver, etc.) Create a java project. Add the selenium-java-.jar files to your project as references. Add to your project classpath the file selenium-java-.jar. From Selenium-IDE, export a script to a Java file and include it in your Java project, or write your Selenium test in Java using the selenium-java-client API. The API is presented later in this chapter. You can either use JUnit, or TestNg to run your test, or you can write your own simple main() program. These concepts are explained later in this section. Run Selenium server from the console. Execute your test from the Java IDE or from the command-line.  For details on Java test project configuration, see the Appendix sections Configuring Selenium RC With Eclipse and Configuring Selenium RC With Intellij.\nUsing the Python Client Driver  Install Selenium via PIP, instructions linked at SeleniumHQ downloads page Either write your Selenium test in Python or export a script from Selenium-IDE to a python file. Run Selenium server from the console Execute your test from a console or your Python IDE  For details on Python client driver configuration, see the appendix Python Client Driver Configuration.\nUsing the .NET Client Driver  Download Selenium RC from the SeleniumHQ downloads page Extract the folder Download and install NUnit ( Note: You can use NUnit as your test engine. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar yet with NUnit, you can also write a simple main() function to run your tests; however NUnit is very useful as a test engine.) Open your desired .Net IDE (Visual Studio, SharpDevelop, MonoDevelop) Create a class library (.dll) Add references to the following DLLs: nmock.dll, nunit.core.dll, nunit. framework.dll, ThoughtWorks.Selenium.Core.dll, ThoughtWorks.Selenium.IntegrationTests.dll and ThoughtWorks.Selenium.UnitTests.dll Write your Selenium test in a .Net language (C#, VB.Net), or export a script from Selenium-IDE to a C# file and copy this code into the class file you just created. Write your own simple main() program or you can include NUnit in your project for running your test. These concepts are explained later in this chapter. Run Selenium server from console Run your test either from the IDE, from the NUnit GUI or from the command line  For specific details on .NET client driver configuration with Visual Studio, see the appendix .NET client driver configuration.\nUsing the Ruby Client Driver  If you do not already have RubyGems, install it from RubyForge. Run gem install selenium-client At the top of your test script, add require \u0026quot;selenium/client\u0026quot; Write your test script using any Ruby test harness (eg Test::Unit, Mini::Test or RSpec). Run Selenium RC server from the console. Execute your test in the same way you would run any other Ruby script.  For details on Ruby client driver configuration, see the Selenium-Client documentation_\nFrom Selenese to a Program The primary task for using Selenium RC is to convert your Selenese into a programming language. In this section, we provide several different language-specific examples.\nSample Test Script Let\u0026rsquo;s start with an example Selenese test script.

There are essentially two tasks:\n Generate your script into a programming language from Selenium-IDE, optionally modifying the result.\n Write a very simple main program that executes the generated code.\n  Optionally, you can adopt a test engine platform like JUnit or TestNG for Java, or NUnit for .NET if you are using one of those languages.\nHere, we show language-specific examples. The language-specific APIs tend to differ from one to another, so you\u0026rsquo;ll find a separate explanation for each.\n Java C# Python Ruby Perl, PHP  Java For Java, people use either JUnit or TestNG as the test engine.\nSome development environments like Eclipse have direct support for these via plug-ins. This makes it even easier. Teaching JUnit or TestNG is beyond the scope of this document however materials may be found online and there are publications available. If you are already a \u0026ldquo;java-shop\u0026rdquo; chances are your developers will already have some experience with one of these test frameworks.\nYou will probably want to rename the test class from \u0026ldquo;NewTest\u0026rdquo; to something of your own choosing. Also, you will need to change the browser-open parameters in the statement:\nselenium = new DefaultSelenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*iehta\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;); The Selenium-IDE generated code will look like this. This example has comments added manually for additional clarity.\npackage com.example.tests; // We specify the package of our tests  import com.thoughtworks.selenium.*; // This is the driver\u0026#39;s import. You\u0026#39;ll use this for instantiating a  // browser and making it do what you need.  import java.util.regex.Pattern; // Selenium-IDE add the Pattern module because it\u0026#39;s sometimes used for  // regex validations. You can remove the module if it\u0026#39;s not used in your  // script.  public class NewTest extends SeleneseTestCase { // We create our Selenium test case  public void setUp() throws Exception { setUp(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;); // We instantiate and start the browser  } public void testNew() throws Exception { selenium.open(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;); selenium.type(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selenium rc\u0026#34;); selenium.click(\u0026#34;btnG\u0026#34;); selenium.waitForPageToLoad(\u0026#34;30000\u0026#34;); assertTrue(selenium.isTextPresent(\u0026#34;Results * for selenium rc\u0026#34;)); // These are the real test steps  } } C# The .NET Client Driver works with Microsoft.NET. It can be used with any .NET testing framework like NUnit or the Visual Studio 2005 Team System.\nSelenium-IDE assumes you will use NUnit as your testing framework. You can see this in the generated code below. It includes the using statement for NUnit along with corresponding NUnit attributes identifying the role for each member function of the test class.\nYou will probably have to rename the test class from \u0026ldquo;NewTest\u0026rdquo; to something of your own choosing. Also, you will need to change the browser-open parameters in the statement:\nselenium = new DefaultSelenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*iehta\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;);  The generated code will look similar to this.\nusing System; using System.Text; using System.Text.RegularExpressions; using System.Threading; using NUnit.Framework; using Selenium; namespace SeleniumTests { [TestFixture] public class NewTest { private ISelenium selenium; private StringBuilder verificationErrors; [SetUp] public void SetupTest() { selenium = new DefaultSelenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*iehta\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;); selenium.Start(); verificationErrors = new StringBuilder(); } [TearDown] public void TeardownTest() { try { selenium.Stop(); } catch (Exception) { // Ignore errors if unable to close the browser  } Assert.AreEqual(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, verificationErrors.ToString()); } [Test] public void TheNewTest() { // Open Google search engine.  selenium.Open(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;); // Assert Title of page.  Assert.AreEqual(\u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, selenium.GetTitle()); // Provide search term as \u0026#34;Selenium OpenQA\u0026#34;  selenium.Type(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Selenium OpenQA\u0026#34;); // Read the keyed search term and assert it.  Assert.AreEqual(\u0026#34;Selenium OpenQA\u0026#34;, selenium.GetValue(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)); // Click on Search button.  selenium.Click(\u0026#34;btnG\u0026#34;); // Wait for page to load.  selenium.WaitForPageToLoad(\u0026#34;5000\u0026#34;); // Assert that \u0026#34;www.openqa.org\u0026#34; is available in search results.  Assert.IsTrue(selenium.IsTextPresent(\u0026#34;www.openqa.org\u0026#34;)); // Assert that page title is - \u0026#34;Selenium OpenQA - Google Search\u0026#34;  Assert.AreEqual(\u0026#34;Selenium OpenQA - Google Search\u0026#34;, selenium.GetTitle()); } } }  You can allow NUnit to manage the execution of your tests. Or alternatively, you can write a simple main() program that instantiates the test object and runs each of the three methods, SetupTest(), TheNewTest(), and TeardownTest() in turn.\nPython Pyunit is the test framework to use for Python.\nThe basic test structure is:\nfrom selenium import selenium # This is the driver\u0026#39;s import. You\u0026#39;ll use this class for instantiating a # browser and making it do what you need. import unittest, time, re # This are the basic imports added by Selenium-IDE by default. # You can remove the modules if they are not used in your script. class NewTest(unittest.TestCase): # We create our unittest test case def setUp(self): self.verificationErrors = [] # This is an empty array where we will store any verification errors # we find in our tests self.selenium = selenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;) self.selenium.start() # We instantiate and start the browser def test_new(self): # This is the test code.

Therefore, it is advisable to update any Ruby scripts generated by the IDE as follows:\n On line 1, change require \u0026quot;selenium\u0026quot; to require \u0026quot;selenium/client\u0026quot;\n On line 11, change Selenium::SeleniumDriver.new to Selenium::Client::Driver.new\n  You probably also want to change the class name to something more informative than \u0026ldquo;Untitled,\u0026rdquo; and change the test method\u0026rsquo;s name to something other than \u0026ldquo;test_untitled.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is a simple example created by modifying the Ruby code generated by Selenium IDE, as described above.\n# load the Selenium-Client gem require \u0026#34;selenium/client\u0026#34; # Load Test::Unit, Ruby\u0026#39;s default test framework. # If you prefer RSpec, see the examples in the Selenium-Client # documentation. require \u0026#34;test/unit\u0026#34; class Untitled \u0026lt; Test::Unit::TestCase # The setup method is called before each test. def setup # This array is used to capture errors and display them at the # end of the test run. @verification_errors = [] # Create a new instance of the Selenium-Client driver. @selenium = Selenium::Client::Driver.new \\ :host =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, :port =\u0026gt; 4444, :browser =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;*chrome\u0026#34;, :url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;, :timeout_in_second =\u0026gt; 60 # Start the browser session @selenium.start # Print a message in the browser-side log and status bar # (optional). @selenium.set_context(\u0026#34;test_untitled\u0026#34;) end # The teardown method is called after each test. def teardown # Stop the browser session. @selenium.stop # Print the array of error messages, if any. assert_equal [], @verification_errors end # This is the main body of your test. def test_untitled # Open the root of the site we specified when we created the # new driver instance, above. @selenium.open \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; # Type \u0026#39;selenium rc\u0026#39; into the field named \u0026#39;q\u0026#39; @selenium.type \u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selenium rc\u0026#34; # Click the button named \u0026#34;btnG\u0026#34; @selenium.click \u0026#34;btnG\u0026#34; # Wait for the search results page to load. # Note that we don\u0026#39;t need to set a timeout here, because that # was specified when we created the new driver instance, above. @selenium.wait_for_page_to_load begin # Test whether the search results contain the expected text. # Notice that the star (*) is a wildcard that matches any # number of characters. assert @selenium.is_text_present(\u0026#34;Results * for selenium rc\u0026#34;) rescue Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError # If the assertion fails, push it onto the array of errors. @verification_errors \u0026lt;\u0026lt; $! end end end Perl, PHP The members of the documentation team have not used Selenium RC with Perl or PHP. If you are using Selenium RC with either of these two languages please contact the Documentation Team (see the chapter on contributing). We would love to include some examples from you and your experiences, to support Perl and PHP users.\nLearning the API The Selenium RC API uses naming conventions that, assuming you understand Selenese, much of the interface\nwill be self-explanatory. Here, however, we explain the most critical and possibly less obvious aspects.\nStarting the Browser CSharp selenium = new DefaultSelenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;); selenium.Start();  Java setUp(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;); Perl my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium-\u0026gt;new( host =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, port =\u0026gt; 4444, browser =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;, browser_url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34; ); Php $this-\u0026gt;setBrowser(\u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;); $this-\u0026gt;setBrowserUrl(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;); Python self.selenium = selenium(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;) self.selenium.start() Ruby @selenium = Selenium::ClientDriver.new(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 4444, \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.google.com/\u0026#34;, 10000); @selenium.start Each of these examples opens the browser and represents that browser by assigning a \u0026ldquo;browser instance\u0026rdquo; to a program variable. This program variable is then used to call methods from the browser. These methods execute the Selenium commands, i.e. like open or type or the verify commands.\nThe parameters required when creating the browser instance are:\n host Specifies the IP address of the computer where the server is located. Usually, this is the same machine as where the client is running, so in this case localhost is passed. In some clients this is an optional parameter.\n port Specifies the TCP/IP socket where the server is listening waiting for the client to establish a connection. This also is optional in some client drivers.\n browser The browser in which you want to run the tests. This is a required parameter.\n url The base url of the application under test. This is required by all the client libs and is integral information for starting up the browser-proxy-AUT communication.\n  Note that some of the client libraries require the browser to be started explicitly by calling its start() method.\nRunning Commands Once you have the browser initialized and assigned to a variable (generally named \u0026ldquo;selenium\u0026rdquo;) you can make it run Selenese commands by calling the respective methods from the browser variable. For example, to call the type method of the selenium object:\nselenium.type(\u0026#34;field-id\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;string to type\u0026#34;) In the background the browser will actually perform a type operation, essentially identical to a user typing input into the browser, by\nusing the locator and the string you specified during the method call.\nReporting Results Selenium RC does not have its own mechanism for reporting results. Rather, it allows you to build your reporting customized to your needs using features of your chosen programming language. That\u0026rsquo;s great, but what if you simply want something quick that\u0026rsquo;s already done for you? Often an existing library or test framework can meet your needs faster than developing your own test reporting code.\nTest Framework Reporting Tools Test frameworks are available for many programming languages. These, along with their primary function of providing a flexible test engine for executing your tests, include library code for reporting results. For example, Java has two commonly used test frameworks, JUnit and TestNG. .NET also has its own, NUnit.\nWe won\u0026rsquo;t teach the frameworks themselves here; that\u0026rsquo;s beyond the scope of this user guide. We will simply introduce the framework features that relate to Selenium along with some techniques you can apply. There are good books available on these test frameworks however along with information on the internet.\nTest Report Libraries Also available are third-party libraries specifically created for reporting test results in your chosen programming language. These often support a variety of formats such as HTML or PDF.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s The Best Approach? Most people new to the testing frameworks will begin with the framework\u0026rsquo;s built-in reporting features. From there most will examine any available libraries as that\u0026rsquo;s less time consuming than developing your own. As you begin to use Selenium no doubt you will start putting in your own \u0026ldquo;print statements\u0026rdquo; for reporting progress. That may gradually lead to you developing your own reporting, possibly in parallel to using a library or test framework. Regardless, after the initial, but short, learning curve you will naturally develop what works best for your own situation.\nTest Reporting Examples To illustrate, we\u0026rsquo;ll direct you to some specific tools in some of the other languages supported by Selenium. The ones listed here are commonly used and have been used extensively (and therefore recommended) by the authors of this guide.\nTest Reports in Java  If Selenium Test cases are developed using JUnit then JUnit Report can be used to generate test reports.\n If Selenium Test cases are developed using TestNG then no external task is required to generate test reports. The TestNG framework generates an HTML report which list details of tests.\n ReportNG is a HTML reporting plug-in for the TestNG framework. It is intended as a replacement for the default TestNG HTML report. ReportNG provides a simple, colour-coded view of the test results.\n  Logging the Selenese Commands  Logging Selenium can be used to generate a report of all the Selenese commands in your test along with the success or failure of each. Logging Selenium extends the Java client driver to add this Selenese logging ability.  Test Reports for Python  When using Python Client Driver then HTMLTestRunner can be used to generate a Test Report.  Test Reports for Ruby  If RSpec framework is used for writing Selenium Test Cases in Ruby then its HTML report can be used to generate a test report.  Adding Some Spice to Your Tests Now we\u0026rsquo;ll get to the whole reason for using Selenium RC, adding programming logic to your tests. It\u0026rsquo;s the same as for any program. Program flow is controlled using condition statements and iteration. In addition you can report progress information using I/O. In this section we\u0026rsquo;ll show some examples of how programming language constructs can be combined with Selenium to solve common testing problems.\nYou will find as you transition from the simple tests of the existence of page elements to tests of dynamic functionality involving multiple web-pages and varying data that you will require programming logic for verifying expected results. Basically, the Selenium-IDE does not support iteration and standard condition statements. You can do some conditions by embedding javascript in Selenese parameters, however iteration is impossible, and most conditions will be much easier in a\nprogramming language. In addition, you may need exception handling for error recovery. For these reasons and others, we have written this section to illustrate the use of common programming techniques to give you greater \u0026lsquo;verification power\u0026rsquo; in your automated testing.\nThe examples in this section are written in C# and Java, although the code is simple and can be easily adapted to the other supported languages. If you have some basic knowledge of an object-oriented programming language you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have difficulty understanding this section.\nIteration Iteration is one of the most common things people need to do in their tests. For example, you may want to to execute a search multiple times. Or, perhaps for verifying your test results you need to process a \u0026ldquo;result set\u0026rdquo; returned from a database.\nUsing the same Google search example we used earlier, let\u0026rsquo;s check the Selenium search results. This test could use the Selenese:\n          open /    type q selenium rc   clickAndWait btnG    assertTextPresent Results * for selenium rc    type q selenium ide   clickAndWait btnG    assertTextPresent Results * for selenium ide    type q selenium grid   clickAndWait btnG    assertTextPresent Results * for selenium grid     The code has been repeated to run the same steps 3 times. But multiple copies of the same code is not good program practice because it\u0026rsquo;s more work to maintain. By using a programming language, we can iterate over the search results for a more flexible and maintainable solution.\nIn C# // Collection of String values.  String[] arr = {\u0026#34;ide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;}; // Execute loop for each String in array \u0026#39;arr\u0026#39;.  foreach (String s in arr) { sel.open(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;); sel.type(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selenium \u0026#34; +s); sel.click(\u0026#34;btnG\u0026#34;); sel.waitForPageToLoad(\u0026#34;30000\u0026#34;); assertTrue(\u0026#34;Expected text: \u0026#34; +s+ \u0026#34; is missing on page.\u0026#34; , sel.isTextPresent(\u0026#34;Results * for selenium \u0026#34; + s)); }  Condition Statements To illustrate using conditions in tests we\u0026rsquo;ll start with an example. A common problem encountered while running Selenium tests occurs when an expected element is not available on page. For example, when running the following line:\nselenium.type(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selenium \u0026#34; +s); If element \u0026lsquo;q\u0026rsquo; is not on the page then an exception is thrown:\ncom.thoughtworks.selenium.SeleniumException: ERROR: Element q not found This can cause your test to abort. For some tests that\u0026rsquo;s what you want. But often that is not desirable as your test script has many other subsequent tests to perform.\nA better approach is to first validate whether the element is really present and then take alternatives when it it is not. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at this using Java.\n// If element is available on page then perform type operation.  if(selenium.isElementPresent(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)) { selenium.type(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Selenium rc\u0026#34;); } else { System.out.printf(\u0026#34;Element: \u0026#34; +q+ \u0026#34; is not available on page.\u0026#34;) } The advantage of this approach is to continue with test execution even if some UI elements are not available on page.\nExecuting JavaScript from Your Test JavaScript comes very handy in exercising an application which is not directly supported by selenium. The getEval method of selenium API can be used to execute JavaScript from selenium RC.\nConsider an application having check boxes with no static identifiers. In this case one could evaluate JavaScript from selenium RC to get ids of all check boxes and then exercise them.\npublic static String[] getAllCheckboxIds () { String script = \u0026#34;var inputId = new Array();\u0026#34;;// Create array in java script. \tscript += \u0026#34;var cnt = 0;\u0026#34;; // Counter for check box ids. \tscript += \u0026#34;var inputFields = new Array();\u0026#34;; // Create array in java script. \tscript += \u0026#34;inputFields = window.document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;);\u0026#34;; // Collect input elements. \tscript += \u0026#34;for(var i=0; i\u0026lt;inputFields.length; i++) {\u0026#34;; // Loop through the collected elements. \tscript += \u0026#34;if(inputFields[i].id !=null \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026amp; inputFields[i].id !=\u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026amp; inputFields[i].getAttribute(\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;) == \u0026#39;checkbox\u0026#39;) {\u0026#34;; // If input field is of type check box and input id is not null. \tscript += \u0026#34;inputId[cnt]=inputFields[i].id ;\u0026#34; + // Save check box id to inputId array. \t\u0026#34;cnt++;\u0026#34; + // increment the counter. \t\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; + // end of if. \t\u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; // end of for. \tscript += \u0026#34;inputId.toString();\u0026#34; ;// Convert array in to string.\t\tString[] checkboxIds = selenium.getEval(script).split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;); // Split the string. \treturn checkboxIds; } To count number of images on a page:\nselenium.getEval(\u0026#34;window.document.images.length;\u0026#34;); Remember to use window object in case of DOM expressions as by default selenium window is referred to, not the test window.\nServer Options When the server is launched, command line options can be used to change the default server behaviour.\nRecall, the server is started by running the following.\n$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar To see the list of options, run the server with the -h option.\n$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar -h You\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of all the options you can use with the server and a brief description of each. The provided descriptions will not always be enough, so we\u0026rsquo;ve provided explanations for some of the more important options.\nProxy Configuration If your AUT is behind an HTTP proxy which requires authentication then you should configure http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort, http.proxyUser and http.proxyPassword using the following command.\n$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.proxyUser=username -Dhttp.proxyPassword=password Multi-Window Mode If you are using Selenium 1.0 you can probably skip this section, since multiwindow mode is the default behavior. However, prior to version 1.0, Selenium by default ran the application under test in a sub frame as shown here.\nSome applications didn\u0026rsquo;t run correctly in a sub frame, and needed to be loaded into the top frame of the window. The multi-window mode option allowed the AUT to run in a separate window rather than in the default frame where it could then have the top frame it required.\nFor older versions of Selenium you must specify multiwindow mode explicitly with the following option:\n-multiwindow  As of Selenium RC 1.0, if you want to run your test within a single frame (i.e. using the standard for earlier Selenium versions) you can state this to the Selenium Server using the option\n-singlewindow  Specifying the Firefox Profile Firefox will not run two instances simultaneously unless you specify a separate profile for each instance. Selenium RC 1.0 and later runs in a separate profile automatically, so if you are using Selenium 1.0, you can probably skip this section. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re using an older version of Selenium or if you need to use a specific profile for your tests (such as adding an https certificate or having some addons installed), you will need to explicitly specify the profile.\nFirst, to create a separate Firefox profile, follow this procedure. Open the Windows Start menu, select \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo;, then type and enter one of the following:\nfirefox.exe -profilemanager firefox.exe -P  Create the new profile using the dialog. Then when you run Selenium Server, tell it to use this new Firefox profile with the server command-line option -firefoxProfileTemplate and specify the path to the profile using its filename and directory path.\n-firefoxProfileTemplate \u0026#34;path to the profile\u0026#34;  Warning: Be sure to put your profile in a new folder separate from the default!!! The Firefox profile manager tool will delete all files in a folder if you delete a profile, regardless of whether they are profile files or not.\nMore information about Firefox profiles can be found in Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Knowledge Base\nRun Selenese Directly Within the Server Using -htmlSuite You can run Selenese html files directly within the Selenium Server by passing the html file to the server\u0026rsquo;s command line. For instance:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar -htmlSuite \u0026#34;*firefox\u0026#34; \u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34; \u0026#34;c:\\absolute\\path\\to\\my\\HTMLSuite.html\u0026#34; \u0026#34;c:\\absolute\\path\\to\\my\\results.html\u0026#34; This will automatically launch your HTML suite, run all the tests and save a nice HTML report with the results.\nNote: When using this option, the server will start the tests and wait for a specified number of seconds for the test to complete; if the test doesn\u0026rsquo;t complete within that amount of time, the command will exit with a non-zero exit code and no results file will be generated.\nThis command line is very long so be careful when you type it. Note this requires you to pass in an HTML Selenese suite, not a single test. Also be aware the -htmlSuite option is incompatible with -interactive You cannot run both at the same time.\nSelenium Server Logging Server-Side Logs When launching selenium server the -log option can be used to record valuable debugging information reported by the Selenium Server to a text file.\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar -log selenium.log This log file is more verbose than the standard console logs (it includes DEBUG level logging messages). The log file also includes the logger name, and the ID number of the thread that logged the message. For example:\n20:44:25 DEBUG [12] org.openqa.selenium.server.SeleniumDriverResourceHandler - Browser 465828/:top frame1 posted START NEW The message format is\nTIMESTAMP(HH:mm:ss) LEVEL [THREAD] LOGGER - MESSAGE This message may be multiline.\nBrowser-Side Logs JavaScript on the browser side (Selenium Core) also logs important messages; in many cases, these can be more useful to the end-user than the regular Selenium Server logs. To access browser-side logs, pass the -browserSideLog argument to the Selenium Server.\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.jar -browserSideLog -browserSideLog must be combined with the -log argument, to log browserSideLogs (as well as all other DEBUG level logging messages) to a file.\nSpecifying the Path to a Specific Browser You can specify to Selenium RC a path to a specific browser. This is useful if you have different versions of the same browser and you wish to use a specific one. Also, this is used to allow your tests to run against a browser not directly supported by Selenium RC. When specifying the run mode, use the *custom specifier followed by the full path to the browser\u0026rsquo;s executable:\n*custom \u0026lt;path to browser\u0026gt;  Selenium RC Architecture Note: This topic tries to explain the technical implementation behind Selenium RC. It\u0026rsquo;s not fundamental for a Selenium user to know this, but could be useful for understanding some of the problems you might find in the future.\nTo understand in detail how Selenium RC Server works and why it uses proxy injection and heightened privilege modes you must first understand the same origin policy_.\nThe Same Origin Policy The main restriction that Selenium faces is the Same Origin Policy. This security restriction is applied by every browser in the market and its objective is to ensure that a site\u0026rsquo;s content will never be accessible by a script from another site. The Same Origin Policy dictates that any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website\u0026rsquo;s domain. It cannot perform functions on another website. So for example, if the browser loads JavaScript code when it loads www.mysite.com, it cannot run that loaded code against www.mysite2.com\u0026ndash;even if that\u0026rsquo;s another of your sites. If this were possible, a script placed on any website you open would be able to read information on your bank account if you had the account page opened on other tab. This is called XSS (Cross-site Scripting).\nTo work within this policy, Selenium-Core (and its JavaScript commands that make all the magic happen) must be placed in the same origin as the Application Under Test (same URL).\nHistorically, Selenium-Core was limited by this problem since it was implemented in JavaScript. Selenium RC is not, however, restricted by the Same Origin Policy. Its use of the Selenium Server as a proxy avoids this problem. It, essentially, tells the browser that the browser is working on a single \u0026ldquo;spoofed\u0026rdquo; website that the Server provides.\nNote: You can find additional information about this topic on Wikipedia pages about Same Origin Policy and XSS.\nProxy Injection The first method Selenium used to avoid the The Same Origin Policy was Proxy Injection. In Proxy Injection Mode, the Selenium Server acts as a client-configured HTTP proxy1, that sits between the browser and the Application Under Test2. It then masks the AUT under a fictional URL (embedding Selenium-Core and the set of tests and delivering them as if they were coming from the same origin).\nHere is an architectural diagram.\nAs a test suite starts in your favorite language, the following happens:\n The client/driver establishes a connection with the selenium-RC server. Selenium RC server launches a browser (or reuses an old one) with a URL that injects Selenium-Core\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript into the browser-loaded web page. The client-driver passes a Selenese command to the server. The Server interprets the command and then triggers the corresponding JavaScript execution to execute that command within the browser. Selenium-Core instructs the browser to act on that first instruction, typically opening a page of the AUT. The browser receives the open request and asks for the website\u0026rsquo;s content from the Selenium RC server (set as the HTTP proxy for the browser to use). Selenium RC server communicates with the Web server asking for the page and once it receives it, it sends the page to the browser masking the origin to look like the page comes from the same server as Selenium-Core (this allows Selenium-Core to comply with the Same Origin Policy). The browser receives the web page and renders it in the frame/window reserved for it.   Heightened Privileges Browsers This workflow in this method is very similar to Proxy Injection but the main difference is that the browsers are launched in a special mode called Heightened Privileges, which allows websites to do things that are not commonly permitted (as doing XSS_, or filling file upload inputs and pretty useful stuff for Selenium). By using these browser modes, Selenium Core is able to directly open the AUT and read/interact with its content without having to pass the whole AUT through the Selenium RC server.\nHere is the architectural diagram.\nAs a test suite starts in your favorite language, the following happens:\n The client/driver establishes a connection with the selenium-RC server. Selenium RC server launches a browser (or reuses an old one) with a URL that will load Selenium-Core in the web page. Selenium-Core gets the first instruction from the client/driver (via another HTTP request made to the Selenium RC Server). Selenium-Core acts on that first instruction, typically opening a page of the AUT. The browser receives the open request and asks the Web Server for the page. Once the browser receives the web page, renders it in the frame/window reserved for it.  Handling HTTPS and Security Popups Many applications switch from using HTTP to HTTPS when they need to send encrypted information such as passwords or credit card information. This is common with many of today\u0026rsquo;s web applications. Selenium RC supports this.\nTo ensure the HTTPS site is genuine, the browser will need a security certificate. Otherwise, when the browser accesses the AUT using HTTPS, it will assume that application is not \u0026lsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo;. When this occurs the browser displays security popups, and these popups cannot be closed using Selenium RC.\nWhen dealing with HTTPS in a Selenium RC test, you must use a run mode that supports this and handles the security certificate for you. You specify the run mode when your test program initializes Selenium.\nIn Selenium RC 1.0 beta 2 and later use *firefox or *iexplore for the run mode. In earlier versions, including Selenium RC 1.0 beta 1, use *chrome or *iehta, for the run mode. Using these run modes, you will not need to install any special security certificates; Selenium RC will handle it for you.\nIn version 1.0 the run modes *firefox or *iexplore are recommended. However, there are additional run modes of *iexploreproxy and *firefoxproxy. These are provided for backwards compatibility only, and should not be used unless required by legacy test programs. Their use will present limitations with security certificate handling and with the running of multiple windows if your application opens additional browser windows.\nIn earlier versions of Selenium RC, *chrome or *iehta were the run modes that supported HTTPS and the handling of security popups. These were considered ‘experimental modes although they became quite stable and many people used them. If you are using Selenium 1.0 you do not need, and should not use, these older run modes.\nSecurity Certificates Explained Normally, your browser will trust the application you are testing by installing a security certificate which you already own. You can check this in your browser\u0026rsquo;s options or Internet properties (if you don\u0026rsquo;t know your AUT\u0026rsquo;s security certificate ask your system administrator). When Selenium loads your browser it injects code to intercept messages between the browser and the server. The browser now thinks untrusted software is trying to look like your application. It responds by alerting you with popup messages.\nTo get around this, Selenium RC, (again when using a run mode that support this) will install its own security certificate, temporarily, to your client machine in a place where the browser can access it. This tricks the browser into thinking it\u0026rsquo;s accessing a site different from your AUT and effectively suppresses the popups.\nAnother method used with earlier versions of Selenium was to install the Cybervillians security certificate provided with your Selenium installation. Most users should no longer need to do this however; if you are running Selenium RC in proxy injection mode, you may need to explicitly install this security certificate.\nSupporting Additional Browsers and Browser Configurations The Selenium API supports running against multiple browsers in addition to Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. See the SeleniumHQ.org website for supported browsers. In addition, when a browser is not directly supported, you may still run your Selenium tests against a browser of your choosing by using the \u0026ldquo;*custom\u0026rdquo; run-mode (i.e. in place of *firefox or *iexplore) when your test application starts the browser. With this, you pass in the path to the browsers executable within the API call. This can also be done from the Server in interactive mode.\ncmd=getNewBrowserSession\u0026amp;1=*custom c:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\MyBrowser.exe\u0026amp;2=http://www.google.com Running Tests with Different Browser Configurations Normally Selenium RC automatically configures the browser, but if you launch the browser using the \u0026ldquo;*custom\u0026rdquo; run mode, you can force Selenium RC to launch the browser as-is, without using an automatic configuration.\nFor example, you can launch Firefox with a custom configuration like this:\ncmd=getNewBrowserSession\u0026amp;1=*custom c:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe\u0026amp;2=http://www.google.com Note that when launching the browser this way, you must manually configure the browser to use the Selenium Server as a proxy. Normally this just means opening your browser preferences and specifying \u0026ldquo;localhost:4444\u0026rdquo; as an HTTP proxy, but instructions for this can differ radically from browser to browser. Consult your browser\u0026rsquo;s documentation for details.\nBe aware that Mozilla browsers can vary in how they start and stop. One may need to set the MOZ_NO_REMOTE environment variable to make Mozilla browsers behave a little more predictably. Unix users should avoid launching the browser using a shell script; it\u0026rsquo;s generally better to use the binary executable (e.g. firefox-bin) directly.\nTroubleshooting Common Problems When getting started with Selenium RC there\u0026rsquo;s a few potential problems that are commonly encountered. We present them along with their solutions here.\nUnable to Connect to Server When your test program cannot connect to the Selenium Server, Selenium throws an exception in your test program. It should display this message or a similar one:\n\u0026#34;Unable to connect to remote server (Inner Exception Message: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it )\u0026#34; (using .NET and XP Service Pack 2)  If you see a message like this, be sure you started the Selenium Server. If so, then there is a problem with the connectivity between the Selenium Client Library and the Selenium Server.\nWhen starting with Selenium RC, most people begin by running their test program (with a Selenium Client Library) and the Selenium Server on the same machine. To do this use \u0026ldquo;localhost\u0026rdquo; as your connection parameter. We recommend beginning this way since it reduces the influence of potential networking problems which you\u0026rsquo;re getting started. Assuming your operating system has typical networking and TCP/IP settings you should have little difficulty. In truth, many people choose to run the tests this way.\nIf, however, you do want to run Selenium Server on a remote machine, the connectivity should be fine assuming you have valid TCP/IP connectivity between the two machines.\nIf you have difficulty connecting, you can use common networking tools like ping, telnet, ifconfig(Unix)/ipconfig (Windows), etc to ensure you have a valid network connection. If unfamilar with these, your system administrator can assist you.\nUnable to Load the Browser Ok, not a friendly error message, sorry, but if the Selenium Server cannot load the browser you will likely see this error.\n(500) Internal Server Error This could be caused by\n Firefox (prior to Selenium 1.0) cannot start because the browser is already open and you did not specify a separate profile. See the section on Firefox profiles under Server Options. The run mode you\u0026rsquo;re using doesn\u0026rsquo;t match any browser on your machine. Check the parameters you passed to Selenium when you program opens the browser. You specified the path to the browser explicitly (using \u0026ldquo;*custom\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;see above) but the path is incorrect. Check to be sure the path is correct. Also check the user group to be sure there are no known issues with your browser and the \u0026ldquo;*custom\u0026rdquo; parameters.  Selenium Cannot Find the AUT If your test program starts the browser successfully, but the browser doesn\u0026rsquo;t display the website you\u0026rsquo;re testing, the most likely cause is your test program is not using the correct URL.\nThis can easily happen. When you use Selenium-IDE to export your script, it inserts a dummy URL. You must manually change the URL to the correct one for your application to be tested.\nFirefox Refused Shutdown While Preparing a Profile This most often occurs when you run your Selenium RC test program against Firefox, but you already have a Firefox browser session running and, you didn\u0026rsquo;t specify a separate profile when you started the Selenium Server. The error from the test program looks like this:\nError: java.lang.RuntimeException: Firefox refused shutdown while preparing a profile  Here\u0026rsquo;s the complete error message from the server:\n16:20:03.919 INFO - Preparing Firefox profile... 16:20:27.822 WARN - GET /selenium-server/driver/?cmd=getNewBrowserSession\u0026amp;1=*fir efox\u0026amp;2=http%3a%2f%2fsage-webapp1.qa.idc.com HTTP/1.1 java.lang.RuntimeException: Firefox refused shutdown while preparing a profile at org.openqa.selenium.server.browserlaunchers.FirefoxCustomProfileLaunc her.waitForFullProfileToBeCreated(FirefoxCustomProfileLauncher.java:277) ... Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.server.browserlaunchers.FirefoxCustomProfileLaunc her$FileLockRemainedException: Lock file still present! C:\\DOCUME~1\\jsvec\\LOCALS ~1\\Temp\\customProfileDir203138\\parent.lock  To resolve this, see the section on Specifying a Separate Firefox Profile\nVersioning Problems Make sure your version of Selenium supports the version of your browser. For example, Selenium RC 0.92 does not support Firefox 3. At times you may be lucky (I was). But don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check which browser versions are supported by the version of Selenium you are using. When in doubt, use the latest release version of Selenium with the most widely used version of your browser.\nError message: \u0026ldquo;(Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)\u0026rdquo; while starting server This error says you\u0026rsquo;re not using a correct version of Java. The Selenium Server requires Java 1.5 or higher.\nTo check double-check your java version, run this from the command line.\njava -version You should see a message showing the Java version.\njava version \u0026#34;1.5.0_07\u0026#34; Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_07-b03) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_07-b03, mixed mode) If you see a lower version number, you may need to update the JRE, or you may simply need to add it to your PATH environment variable.\n404 error when running the getNewBrowserSession command If you\u0026rsquo;re getting a 404 error while attempting to open a page on \u0026ldquo;http://www.google.com/selenium-server/\u0026quot;, then it must be because the Selenium Server was not correctly configured as a proxy. The \u0026ldquo;selenium-server\u0026rdquo; directory doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist on google.com; it only appears to exist when the proxy is properly configured. Proxy Configuration highly depends on how the browser is launched with firefox, iexplore, opera, or custom.\n iexplore: If the browser is launched using *iexplore, you could be having a problem with Internet Explorer\u0026rsquo;s proxy settings. Selenium Server attempts To configure the global proxy settings in the Internet Options Control Panel. You must make sure that those are correctly configured when Selenium Server launches the browser. Try looking at your Internet Options control panel. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Connections\u0026rdquo; tab and click on \u0026ldquo;LAN Settings\u0026rdquo;.\n If you need to use a proxy to access the application you want to test, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to start Selenium Server with \u0026ldquo;-Dhttp.proxyHost\u0026rdquo;; see the Proxy Configuration_ for more details. You may also try configuring your proxy manually and then launching the browser with *custom, or with *iehta browser launcher.   custom: When using *custom you must configure the proxy correctly(manually), otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll get a 404 error. Double-check that you\u0026rsquo;ve configured your proxy settings correctly. To check whether you\u0026rsquo;ve configured the proxy correctly is to attempt to intentionally configure the browser incorrectly. Try configuring the browser to use the wrong proxy server hostname, or the wrong port. If you had successfully configured the browser\u0026rsquo;s proxy settings incorrectly, then the browser will be unable to connect to the Internet, which is one way to make sure that one is adjusting the relevant settings.\n For other browsers (*firefox, *opera) we automatically hard-code the proxy for you, and so there are no known issues with this functionality. If you\u0026rsquo;re encountering 404 errors and have followed this user guide carefully post your results to user group for some help from the user community.\n  Permission Denied Error The most common reason for this error is that your session is attempting to violate the same-origin policy by crossing domain boundaries (e.g., accesses a page from http://domain1 and then accesses a page from http://domain2) or switching protocols (moving from http://domainX to https://domainX).\nThis error can also occur when JavaScript attempts to find UI objects which are not yet available (before the page has completely loaded), or are no longer available (after the page has started to be unloaded). This is most typically encountered with AJAX pages which are working with sections of a page or subframes that load and/or reload independently of the larger page.\nThis error can be intermittent. Often it is impossible to reproduce the problem with a debugger because the trouble stems from race conditions which are not reproducible when the debugger\u0026rsquo;s overhead is added to the system. Permission issues are covered in some detail in the tutorial. Read the section about the The Same Origin Policy, Proxy Injection carefully.\nHandling Browser Popup Windows There are several kinds of \u0026ldquo;Popups\u0026rdquo; that you can get during a Selenium test. You may not be able to close these popups by running selenium commands if they are initiated by the browser and not your AUT. You may need to know how to manage these. Each type of popup needs to be addressed differently.\n HTTP basic authentication dialogs: These dialogs prompt for a username/password to login to the site. To login to a site that requires HTTP basic authentication, use a username and password in the URL, as described in RFC 1738_, like this: open(\u0026ldquo;http://myusername:myuserpassword@myexample.com/blah/blah/blah\u0026quot;).\n SSL certificate warnings: Selenium RC automatically attempts to spoof SSL certificates when it is enabled as a proxy; see more on this in the section on HTTPS. If your browser is configured correctly, you should never see SSL certificate warnings, but you may need to configure your browser to trust our dangerous \u0026ldquo;CyberVillains\u0026rdquo; SSL certificate authority. Again, refer to the HTTPS section for how to do this.\n modal JavaScript alert/confirmation/prompt dialogs: Selenium tries to conceal those dialogs from you (by replacing window.alert, window.confirm and window.prompt) so they won\u0026rsquo;t stop the execution of your page. If you\u0026rsquo;re seeing an alert pop-up, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because it fired during the page load process, which is usually too early for us to protect the page. Selenese contains commands for asserting or verifying alert and confirmation popups. See the sections on these topics in Chapter 4.\n  On Linux, why isn\u0026rsquo;t my Firefox browser session closing? On Unix/Linux you must invoke \u0026ldquo;firefox-bin\u0026rdquo; directly, so make sure that executable is on the path. If executing Firefox through a shell script, when it comes time to kill the browser Selenium RC will kill the shell script, leaving the browser running. You can specify the path to firefox-bin directly, like this.\ncmd=getNewBrowserSession\u0026amp;1=*firefox /usr/local/firefox/firefox-bin\u0026amp;2=http://www.google.com Firefox *chrome doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with custom profile Check Firefox profile folder -\u0026gt; prefs.js -\u0026gt; user_pref(\u0026ldquo;browser.startup.page\u0026rdquo;, 0); Comment this line like this: \u0026ldquo;//user_pref(\u0026ldquo;browser.startup.page\u0026rdquo;, 0);\u0026rdquo; and try again.\nIs it ok to load a custom pop-up as the parent page is loading (i.e., before the parent page\u0026rsquo;s javascript window.onload() function runs)? No. Selenium relies on interceptors to determine window names as they are being loaded. These interceptors work best in catching new windows if the windows are loaded AFTER the onload() function. Selenium may not recognize windows loaded before the onload function.\nFirefox on Linux On Unix/Linux, versions of Selenium before 1.0 needed to invoke \u0026ldquo;firefox-bin\u0026rdquo; directly, so if you are using a previous version, make sure that the real executable is on the path.\nOn most Linux distributions, the real firefox-bin is located on:\n/usr/lib/firefox-x.x.x/  Where the x.x.x is the version number you currently have. So, to add that path to the user\u0026rsquo;s path. you will have to add the following to your .bashrc file:\nexport PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/usr/lib/firefox-x.x.x/\u0026#34; If necessary, you can specify the path to firefox-bin directly in your test, like this:\n\u0026#34;*firefox /usr/lib/firefox-x.x.x/firefox-bin\u0026#34; IE and Style Attributes If you are running your tests on Internet Explorer and you cannot locate elements using their style attribute. For example:\n//td[@style=\u0026#34;background-color:yellow\u0026#34;] This would work perfectly in Firefox, Opera or Safari but not with IE. IE interprets the keys in @style as uppercase. So, even if the source code is in lowercase, you should use:\n//td[@style=\u0026#34;BACKGROUND-COLOR:yellow\u0026#34;] This is a problem if your test is intended to work on multiple browsers, but you can easily code your test to detect the situation and try the alternative locator that only works in IE.\nError encountered - \u0026ldquo;Cannot convert object to primitive value\u0026rdquo; with shut down of *googlechrome browser To avoid this error you have to start browser with an option that disables same origin policy checks:\nselenium.start(\u0026#34;commandLineFlags=--disable-web-security\u0026#34;); Error encountered in IE - \u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t open app window; is the pop-up blocker enabled?\u0026rdquo; To avoid this error you have to configure the browser: disable the popup blocker AND uncheck \u0026lsquo;Enable Protected Mode\u0026rsquo; option in Tools \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Options \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Security.\n The proxy is a third person in the middle that passes the ball between the two parts. It acts as a \u0026ldquo;web server\u0026rdquo; that delivers the AUT to the browser. Being a proxy gives Selenium Server the capability of \u0026ldquo;lying\u0026rdquo; about the AUT\u0026rsquo;s real URL.\n[return] The browser is launched with a configuration profile that has set localhost:4444 as the HTTP proxy, this is why any HTTP request that the browser does will pass through Selenium server and the response will pass through it and not from the real server.

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser. Odds are good that, at some point, if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.\nFunctional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It\u0026rsquo;s a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.\nOnce you have made the determination that you\u0026rsquo;re in the web browser testing business, and you have your Selenium environment ready to begin writing tests, you will generally perform some combination of three steps:\n Set up the data Perform a discrete set of actions Evaluate the results  You will want to keep these steps as short as possible; one to two operations should be enough much of the time. Browser automation has the reputation of being “flaky”, but in reality that is because users frequently demand too much of it. In later chapters, we will return to techniques you can use to mitigate apparent intermittent problems in tests, in particular on how to overcome race conditions between the browser and WebDriver.\nBy keeping your tests short and using the web browser only when you have absolutely no alternative, you can have many tests with minimal flake.\nA distinct advantage of Selenium tests are their inherent ability to test all components of the application, from backend to frontend, from a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective. So in other words, whilst functional tests may be expensive to run, they also encompass large business-critical portions at one time.\nTesting requirements As mentioned before, Selenium tests can be expensive to run. To what extent depends on the browser you\u0026rsquo;re running the tests against, but historically browsers\u0026rsquo; behaviour has varied so much that it has often been a stated goal to cross-test against multiple browsers.\nSelenium allows you to run the same instructions against multiple browsers on multiple operating systems, but the enumeration of all the possible browsers, their different versions, and the many operating systems they run on will quickly become a non-trivial undertaking.\nLet’s start with an example Larry has written a web site which allows users to order their own custom unicorns.\nThe general workflow (what we\u0026rsquo;ll call the “happy path”) is something like this:\n Create an account Configure the unicorn Add it to the shopping cart Check out and pay Give feedback about the unicorn  It would be tempting to write one grand Selenium script to perform all these operations–many will try. Resist the temptation! Doing so will result in a test that a) takes a long time, b) will be subject to some common issues around page rendering timing issues, and c) is such that if it fails, it won\u0026rsquo;t give you a concise, “glanceable” method for diagnosing what went wrong.\nThe preferred strategy for testing this scenario would be to break it down to a series of independent, speedy tests, each of which has one “reason” to exist.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pretend you want to test the second step: Configuring your unicorn. It will perform the following actions:\n Create an account Configure a unicorn  Note that we are skipping the rest of these steps, we will test the rest of the workflow in other small, discrete test cases, after we are done with this one.\nTo start off, you need to create an account. Here you have some choices to make:\n Do you want to use an existing account? Do you want to create a new account? Are there any special properties of such a user that need to be taken into account before configuration begins?  Regardless of how you answer this question, the solution is to make it part of the \u0026ldquo;set up the data\u0026rdquo; portion of the test– if Larry has exposed an API which enables you (or anyone) to create and update user accounts, be sure to use that to answer this question– if possible, you want to launch the browser only after you have a user \u0026ldquo;in hand\u0026rdquo;, whose credentials you can just log in with.\nIf each test for each workflow begins with the creation of a user account, many seconds will be added to the execution of each test. Calling an API and talking to a database are quick, “headless” operations that don\u0026rsquo;t require the expensive process of opening a browser, navigating to the right pages, clicking and waiting for the forms to be submitted, etc.\nIdeally, you can address this set-up phase in one line of code, which will execute before any browser is launched:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. User user = UserFactory.createCommonUser(); //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. AccountPage accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());   # Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, # but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have # administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email # address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to # know them. user = user_factory.create_common_user() #This method is defined elsewhere. # Log in as this user. # Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the # AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then # perform actions from the AccountPage. account_page = login_as(user.get_email(), user.get_password())   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. val user = UserFactory.createCommonUser() //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. val accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword())     As you can imagine, the UserFactory can be extended to provide methods such as createAdminUser(), and createUserWithPayment(). The point is, these two lines of code do not distract you from the ultimate purpose of this test: configuring a unicorn.\nThe intricacies of the Page Object model will be discussed in later chapters, but we will introduce the concept here:\nYour tests should be composed of actions, performed from the user\u0026rsquo;s point of view, within the context of pages in the site. These pages are stored as objects, which will contain specific information about how the web page is composed and how actions are performed– very little of which should concern you as a tester.\nWhat kind of unicorn do you want? You might want pink, but not necessarily. Purple has been quite popular lately. Does she need sunglasses? Star tattoos? These choices, while difficult, are your primary concern as a tester– you need to ensure that your order fulfillment center sends out the right unicorn to the right person, and that starts with these choices.\nNotice that nowhere in that paragraph do we talk about buttons, fields, drop-downs, radio buttons, or web forms. Neither should your tests! You want to write your code like the user trying to solve their problem. Here is one way of doing this (continuing from the previous example):\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. // This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact // with the browser in any way. Unicorn sparkles = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS); // Since we\u0026#39;re already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the // actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method // takes us there. AddUnicornPage addUnicornPage = accountPage.addUnicorn(); // Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to // its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, // fill out the form, and click submit. UnicornConfirmationPage unicornConfirmationPage = addUnicornPage.createUnicorn(sparkles);   # The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. # This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact # with the browser in any way. sparkles = Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS) # Since we\u0026#39;re already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the # actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method # takes us there. add_unicorn_page = account_page.add_unicorn() # Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to # its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, # fill out the form, and click submit. unicorn_confirmation_page = add_unicorn_page.create_unicorn(sparkles)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. // This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact // with the browser in any way. val sparkles = Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS) // Since we are already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the // actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method // takes us there. val addUnicornPage = accountPage.addUnicorn() // Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to // its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, // fill out the form, and click submit. unicornConfirmationPage = addUnicornPage.createUnicorn(sparkles)     Now that you have configured your unicorn, you need to move on to step 3: making sure it actually worked.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles // object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare // them with the fields on the page. Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;, unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles));   # The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles # object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare # them with the fields on the page. assert unicorn_confirmation_page.exists(sparkles), \u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles // object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare // them with the fields on the page. //CHECK Boris assertTrue(\u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;, unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles))     Note that the tester still has not done anything but talk about unicorns in this code– no buttons, no locators, no browser controls. This method of modelling the application allows you to keep these test-level commands in place and unchanging, even if Larry decides next week that he no longer likes Ruby-on-Rails and decides to re-implement the entire site in the latest Haskell bindings with a Fortran front-end.\nYour page objects will require some small maintenance in order to conform to the site redesign, but these tests will remain the same. Taking this basic design, you will want to keep going through your workflows with the fewest browser-facing steps possible. Your next workflow will involve adding a unicorn to the shopping cart. You will probably want many iterations of this test in order to make sure the cart is keeping its state properly: Is there more than one unicorn in the cart before you start? How many can fit in the shopping cart? If you create more than one with the same name and/or features, will it break? Will it only keep the existing one or will it add another?\nEach time you move through the workflow, you want to try to avoid having to create an account, login as the user, and configure the unicorn. Ideally, you will be able to create an account and pre-configure a unicorn via the API or database. Then all you have to do is log in as the user, locate Sparkles, and add her to the cart.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.\nYour users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty; they want to book travel to Alaska; they want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you are working on, such that the test scripts (the user\u0026rsquo;s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for, and represent the user.\nWith Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).\nBenefits  Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it. Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication. Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality. Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT*.  Java Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.\n/** * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;. * @return An instance of the AccountPage */ public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) { WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;loginField\u0026#34;)); loginField.clear(); loginField.sendKeys(username); // Fill out the password field. The locator we\u0026#39;re using is \u0026#34;By.id\u0026#34;, and we should  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;)); passwordField.clear(); passwordField.sendKeys(password); // Click the login button, which happens to have the id \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;.  driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;)).click(); // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium  // PageFactory).  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class); } This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all a tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.\npublic void loginTest() { loginAsUser(\u0026#34;cbrown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cl0wn3\u0026#34;); // Now that we\u0026#39;re logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support  // our testers, it\u0026#39;s as easy as choosing from available methods.  do.something(); do.somethingElse(); Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Something should have been done!\u0026#34;, something.wasDone()); // Note that we still haven\u0026#39;t referred to a button or web control anywhere in this  // script... } It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they do not care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.\n*AUT: Application under test\n"

We do this by pointing the URL to the address of the server running our tests. In order to customize our configuration, we set desired capabilities. Below is an example of instantiating a remote WebDriver object pointing to our remote web server, www.example.com, running our tests on Firefox.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin FirefoxOptions firefoxOptions = new FirefoxOptions(); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    FirefoxOptions firefoxOptions = new FirefoxOptions(); IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions); driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.Quit();   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, url: \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, desired_capabilities: :firefox driver.get \u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34; driver.close   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    firefoxOptions = FirefoxOptions() driver: WebDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;) driver.quit()     To further customize our test configuration, we can add other desired capabilities.\nDesired capabilities Desired capabilities can be expanded further. All remote Webdriver capabilities are sent through JsonWireProtocol. For a list of configurable capabilities, and more information on JsonWireProtocol, please visit the documentation here.\nFor example, suppose you wanted to run Chrome on Windows XP, using Chrome version 67:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome caps.platform = Windows XP caps.version = 67 driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, :desired_capabilities =\u0026gt; caps   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val chromeOptions = ChromeOptions() chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); val driver: WebDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;) driver.quit();     Local file detector The Local File Detector allows the transfer of files from the client machine to the remote server. For example, if a test needs to upload a file to a web application, a remote WebDriver can automatically transfer the file from the local machine to the remote web server during runtime. This allows the file to be uploaded from the remote machine running the test. It is not enabled by default and can be enabled in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.file_detector = lambda do |args| # args =\u0026gt; [\u0026#34;/path/to/file\u0026#34;] str = args.first.to_s str if File.exist?(str) end   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector())     Once the above code is defined, you can upload a file in your test in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;); WebElement upload = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)); upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.navigate.to \u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34; element = @driver.find_element(:id, \u0026#39;myfile\u0026#39;) element.send_keys \u0026#34;/Users/sso/SauceLabs/sauce/hostess/maitred/maitred/public/images/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;) val upload: WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)) upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;)     "

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.\nWebDriver\u0026rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers. For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies, please see Driver Idiosyncracies.\nEven though all the drivers share a single user-facing interface for controlling the browser, they have slightly different ways of setting up browser sessions. Since many of the driver implementations are provided by third parties, they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution.\nDriver instantiation, profile management, and various browser specific settings are examples of parameters that have different requirements depending on the browser. This section explains the basic requirements for getting you started with the different browsers.\nAdding Executables to your PATH Most drivers require an extra executable for Selenium to communicate with the browser. You can manually specify where the executable lives before starting WebDriver, but this can make your tests less portable, as the executables will need to be in the same place on every machine, or included within your test code repository.\nBy adding a folder containing WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s binaries to your system\u0026rsquo;s path, Selenium will be able to locate the additional binaries without requiring your test code to locate the exact location of the driver.\n Create a directory to place the executables in, like C:\\WebDriver\\bin or /opt/WebDriver/bin Add the directory to your PATH:\n On Windows - Open a command prompt as administrator and the run the following command to permanently add the directory to your path for all users on your machine:\nsetx /m path \u0026#34;%path%;C:\\WebDriver\\bin\\\u0026#34; Bash users on macOS and Linux - In a terminal:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/WebDriver/bin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile  You are now ready to test your changes. Close all open command prompts and open a new one. Type out the name of one of the binaries in the folder you created in the previous step, e.g:\nchromedriver If your PATH is configured correctly, you will see some some output relating to the startup of the driver:\nStarting ChromeDriver 2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1) on port 9515 Only local connections are allowed.  You can regain control of your command prompt by pressing Ctrl + C\nQuick reference    Browser Supported OS Maintained by Download Issue Tracker     Chromium/Chrome Windows/macOS/Linux Google Downloads Issues   Firefox Windows/macOS/Linux Mozilla Downloads Issues   Edge Windows 10 Microsoft Downloads Issues   Internet Explorer Windows Selenium Project Downloads Issues   Safari macOS El Capitan and newer Apple Built in Issues   Opera Windows/macOS/Linux Opera Downloads Issues    Chromium/Chrome To drive Chrome or Chromium, you have to download chromedriver and put it in a folder that is on your system\u0026rsquo;s path.\nOn Linux or macOS, this means modifying the PATH environmental variable. You can see what directories, separated by a colon, make up your system\u0026rsquo;s path by executing the following command:\n$ echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin To include chromedriver on the path if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already, make sure you include the chromedriver binary\u0026rsquo;s parent directory. The following line will set the PATH environmental variable its current content, plus an additional path added after the colon:\n$ export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34; When chromedriver is available on your path, you should be able to execute the chromedriver executable from any directory.\nTo instantiate a Chrome/Chromium session, you can do the following:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Chrome driver = Chrome() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Chrome with Chrome() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); const chrome = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver/chrome\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;chrome\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver val driver: WebDriver = ChromeDriver()     Remember that you have to set the path to the chromedriver executable. This is possible using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Chrome(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;)   new ChromeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;   chrome.setDefaultService(new chrome.ServiceBuilder(\u0026#39;path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;).build());   System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;)     The chromedriver is implemented as a WebDriver remote server that by exposing Chrome\u0026rsquo;s internal automation proxy interface instructs the browser what to do.\nFirefox Starting with Selenium 3, Mozilla has taken over implementation of Firefox Driver, with geckodriver. The new driver for Firefox is called geckodriver and works with Firefox 48 and newer. Since the Firefox WebDriver is under development, the newer the Firefox version the better the support.\nAs geckodriver is the new default way of launching Firefox, you can instantiate Firefox in the same way as Selenium 2:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver; WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Firefox driver = Firefox() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Firefox with Firefox() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;firefox\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver val driver: WebDriver = FirefoxDriver()     If you prefer not to set geckodriver\u0026rsquo;s location using PATH, set the geckodriver binary location programmatically:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Firefox(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#39;)   new FirefoxDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;)     It is also possible to set the property at run time:\nmvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver It is currently possible to revert to the older, more feature complete Firefox driver, by installing Firefox 47.0.1 or 45 ESR and specifying a desired capability of marionette as false. Later releases of Firefox are no longer compatible.\nEdge Edge is Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s newest browser, included with Windows 10 and Server 2016. Updates to Edge are bundled with major Windows updates, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download a binary which matches the build number of your currently installed build of Windows. The Edge Developer site contains links to all the available binaries. Bugs against the EdgeDriver implementation can be raised with Microsoft. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to run tests against Edge, but aren\u0026rsquo;t running Windows 10, Microsoft offer free VMs for testers on the Edge Developer site.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver; WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Edge driver = Edge() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Edge with Edge() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Edge; IWebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :edge   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;MicrosoftEdge\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver val driver: WebDriver = EdgeDriver()     If Edge driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Edge(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#39;)   new EdgeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Edge.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Internet Explorer Internet Explorer was Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s default browser until Windows 10, although it is still included in Windows 10. Internet Explorer Driver is the only driver The Selenium project aims to support the same releases Microsoft considers current. Older releases may work, but will be unsupported.\nWhile the Selenium project provides binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer, there are some limitations with Internet Explorer 10 \u0026amp; 11 with the 64-bit driver, but using the 32-bit driver continues to work well. It should be noted that as Internet Explorer preferences are saved against the logged in user\u0026rsquo;s account, some additional setup is required.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver; WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Ie driver = Ie() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Ie with Ie() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.IE; IWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :internet_explorer   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;internet explorer\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver val driver: WebDriver = InternetExplorerDriver()     If Internet Explorer driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Ie(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe\u0026#39;)   new InternetExplorerDriver(\u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::IE.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Microsoft also offer a WebDriver binary for Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 \u0026amp; 8.1. It has not been updated since 2014 and is based of a draft version of the W3 specification. Jim Evans has an excellent writeup on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s implementation.\nOpera Current releases of Opera are built on top of the Chromium engine, and WebDriver is now supported via the closed-source Opera Chromium Driver, which can be added to your PATH or as a system property.\nInstantiating a driver session is similar to Firefox and Chromium:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver; WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Opera driver = Opera() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Opera with Opera() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Opera; IWebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver val driver: WebDriver = OperaDriver()     Safari Starting with Safari 10 on macOS El Capitan and Sierra, WebDriver support is included with each release of the browser. To enable support:\n Enable the Developer menu from Safari preferences Check the Allow Remote Automation option from with the Develop menu Run the following command from the terminal for the first time and type your password at the prompt to authorise WebDriver\n/usr/bin/safaridriver -p 1337\u0026lt;/  You can then start a driver session using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver; WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Safari driver = Safari() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Safari with Safari() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Safari; IWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :safari   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;safari\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver val driver: WebDriver = SafariDriver()     Those looking to automate Safari on iOS should look to the Appium project. Whilst Safari was previously available for Windows, Apple has long since dropped support, making it a poor choice of test platform.\nMock browsers HtmlUnit HtmlUnit is a \u0026ldquo;GUI-Less browser for Java programs\u0026rdquo;. It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc. It has JavaScript support and is able to work with AJAX libraries, simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used. It has been moved to a new location. The source is maintained on svn.\nPhantomJS PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, albeit a version much older than that used by Google Chrome or Safari. Whilst historically a popular choice, it would now be wise to avoid PhantomJS. The project has been unmaintained since the 5th of August, so whilst the web will continue to change, PhantomJS will not be updated. This was after Google announced the ability to run Chrome headlessly, something also now offered by Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n You will occasionally want to validate the colour of something as part of your tests; the problem is that colour definitions on the web are not constant. Would it not be nice if there was an easy way to compare a HEX representation of a colour with a RGB representation of a colour, or a RGBA representation of a colour with a HSLA representation of a colour?\nWorry not. There is a solution: the Color class!\nFirst of all, you will need to import the class:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color;   from selenium.webdriver.support.color import Color   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color    You can now start creating colour objects.

The Color class also supports this:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;);   TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;)     You can now safely query an element to get its colour/background colour knowing that any response will be correctly parsed and converted into a valid Color object:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin Color loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;); Color loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;);   login_button_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    login_button_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;) val loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;)     You can then directly compare colour objects:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK);   assert login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK))     Or you can convert the colour into one of the following formats and perform a static validation:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;);   assert login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;))     Colours are no longer a problem.\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n For some browser configurations in Selenium RC, Selenium acted as a proxy between the browser and the site being automated. This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.\nSelenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user and this is represented in the way you write tests with WebDriver. In automated functional testing, checking the status code is not a particularly important detail of a test\u0026rsquo;s failure; the steps that preceded it are more important.\nThe browser will always represent the HTTP status code, imagine for example a 404 or a 500 error page. A simple way to “fail fast” when you encounter one of these error pages is to check the page title or content of a reliable point (e.g. the \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag) after every page load. If you are using the page object model, you can include this check in your class constructor or similar point where the page load is expected. Occasionally, the HTTP code may even be represented in the browser\u0026rsquo;s error page and you could use WebDriver to read this and improve your debugging output.\nChecking the webpage itself is in line with WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s ideal practice of representing and asserting upon the user’s view of the website.\nIf you insist, an advanced solution to capturing HTTP status codes is to replicate the behaviour of Selenium RC by using a proxy. WebDriver API provides the ability to set a proxy for the browser, and there are a number of proxies that will programmatically allow you to manipulate the contents of requests sent to and received from the web server. Using a proxy lets you decide how you want to respond to redirection response codes. Additionally, not every browser makes the response codes available to WebDriver, so opting to use a proxy allows you to have a solution that works for every browser.\n"

La méthode findElement(By) retourne un autre type d\u0026rsquo;objet fondamental, un WebElement.\n WebDriver represente la navigateur WebElement represente un noeud particulier du DOM (un lien, un champ texte, etc.)  Un fois que l\u0026rsquo;on a obtenu la référence de l\u0026rsquo;élément web qui a été \u0026ldquo;trouvé\u0026rdquo;, on peut encore réduire la portée de notre recherche en utilisant le même appel de méthode sur l\u0026rsquo;instance de cet objet:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement fromage = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)); WebElement cheddar = fromage.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   fromage = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;) cheddar = fromage.find_elements_by_id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   IWebElement fromage = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)); IWebElement cheddar = fromage.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   fromage = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;) cheddar = fromage.find_elements(id: \u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   const fromage = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;fromage\u0026#39;)); const cheddar = await fromage.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheddar\u0026#39;));   val cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)) val cheddar = cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;))     Nous pouvons faire cela car les types WebDriver et WebElement implémentent tous deux l\u0026rsquo;interface SearchContext. Dans WebDriver, ce principe est connu sous le nom de role-based interface. Les interfaces basées sur le rôle nous permettent de déterminer si une implémentation particulière de driver supporte une fonctionnalité donnée. Ces interfaces sont clairement définies et tente d\u0026rsquo;adhérer au principe de responsabilité unique. Vous pouvez en lire plus sur le design de WebDriver et sur quels drivers supportent quels rôles dans le chapitre Un Autre Chapitre Qui Aura Un Nom. Par conséquent, l\u0026rsquo;interface By utilisée précédement fournit également d\u0026rsquo;autres stratégies de localisation. Une recherche imbriquée peut ne pas être la startégie la plus adaptée pour trouver notre cheddar puisqu\u0026rsquo;elle nécessite que deux instructions séparées soient envoyées au navigateur ; tout d\u0026rsquo;abord rechercher un élément ayant pour ID \u0026ldquo;fromage\u0026rdquo;, puis une recherche pour \u0026ldquo;cheddar\u0026rdquo; dans ce contexte plus restreint.\nPour améliorer légèrement les performances, nous pourrions essayer un sélecteur (une stratégie de localisation) plus spécifique : WebDriver supporte la localisation d\u0026rsquo;élément via sélecteur CSS, nous permettant de combiner les deux sélecteurs précédents en un seul:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheddar = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;)   driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheddar = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#39;));   driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;))     Localiser plusieurs éléments Il est possible que le document web sur lequel nous travaillons dispose d\u0026rsquo;une liste ordonnée de nos fromages préférés:\n\u0026lt;ol id=fromage\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li id=cheddar\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=brie\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=rochefort\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=camembert\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; Puisque plus de fromage est sans conteste meilleur, et qu\u0026rsquo;il serait lourd de devoir récupérer chaque item un par un, une technique supérieure est d\u0026rsquo;utiliser la forme plurielle findElements(By). Cette méthode retourne une collection d\u0026rsquo;éléments web. Si un seul élement a été trouvé, la méthode renverra tout de même une collection (d\u0026rsquo;un seul élément). Si aucun élément ne correspond au sélécteur, la collection retournée sera alors vide.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; pleinDeFromage = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;));   plein_de_fromage = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;)   IReadOnlyList\u0026lt;IWebElement\u0026gt; pleinDeFromage = driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(“#fromage li”));   plein_de_fromage = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;)   const pleinDeFromage = await driver.findElements(By.css(\u0026#39;#fromage li\u0026#39;));   val muchoCheese: List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;))     Stratégie de sélection des éléments WebDriver possède huit stratégies de localisation pré-définies différentes:\n   Sélecteur Description     class name Localise les éléments dont le nom de la classe contient la valeur recherchée (nom composés non permis)   css selector Localise les éléments correspondant à un sélecteur CSS   id Localise les éléments dont l\u0026rsquo;attribut ID correspond à la valeur recherchée   name Localise les éléments dont l\u0026rsquo;attribut NAME correspond à la valeur recherchée   link text Localise les éléments de type ancre (lien) dont le texte visible correspond à la valeur recherchée   partial link text Localise les éléments de type ancre (lien) dont le texte visible contient la valeur recherchée   tag name Localise les éléments dont le nom de tag correspond à la valeur recherchée   xpath Localise les éléments correspondant à un chemin XPath    Astuces d\u0026rsquo;utilisation des sélecteurs En règle général, si des ID HTML sont disponibles, uniques et prédictibles avec constance, alors il est préférable d\u0026rsquo;utiliser cette stratégie pour la localisation d\u0026rsquo;élément sur une page. Elle a tendance à être très rapide et évite les longs traitements liés à des traversées complexes du DOM.\nSi des IDs uniques ne sont pas disponibles, un sélecteur CSS bien écrit est la méthode de localisation la plus adaptée. Un sélecteur XPath marchera aussi bien qu\u0026rsquo;un sélecteur CSS, cependant sa syntaxe est plus complexe, et souvent, plus compliquée à débugguer. Même si les sélecteur XPath sont très flexibles, ils sont rarement testés d\u0026rsquo;un point de vue performance par les fournisseurs de navigateur et ont donc tendance à être assez lents.\nLes stratégies basés sur link text et partial link text sont contraingnantes du fait qu\u0026rsquo;elles ne fonctionnent que sur des éléments de type lien hypertexte. De plus, elles sont implémentées au sein de WebDriver via des sélecteurs XPath.\nLe nom de tag est une façon dangereuse de localiser des éléments. Il y a fréquemment de multiples éléments ayant le même tag sur une page. Cette stratégie est principalement utile lorsque utilisée avec la méthode findElements(By), renvoyant une collection des élements.\nAu final, la recommendation est de garder ses sélecteurs aussi compacts et lisibles que possible. Demander à WebDriver de traverser la structure du DOM est une opération très coûteuse, de fait plus le scope de recherche sera restreint, meilleures seront les performances.\n"

If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.getWindowHandle();  driver.current_window_handle  driver.CurrentWindowHandle;   driver.window_handle  await driver.getWindowHandle();   driver.getWindowHandle()    Switching windows or tabs Clicking a link which opens in a new window will focus the new window or tab on screen, but WebDriver will not know which window the Operating System considers active. To work with the new window you will need to switch to it. If you have only two tabs or windows open, and you know which window you start with, by the process of elimination you can loop over both windows or tabs that WebDriver can see, and switch to the one which is not the original.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Store the ID of the original window String originalWindow = driver.getWindowHandle(); //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert driver.getWindowHandles().size() == 1; //Click the link which opens in a new window driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;)).click();

Assuming you followed the code sample in the previous section you will have the previous window handle stored in a variable. Put this together and you will get:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Close the tab or window driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close() #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window(original_window)   //Close the tab or window driver.Close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.SwitchTo().Window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window original_window   //Close the tab or window await driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window await driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   //Close the tab or window driver.close() //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow)     Forgetting to switch back to another window handle after closing a window will leave WebDriver executing on the now closed page, and will trigger a No Such Window Exception. You must switch back to a valid window handle in order to continue execution.\nQuitting the browser at the end of a session When you are finished with the browser session you should call quit, instead of close:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.quit();  driver.quit()  driver.Quit();   driver.quit  await driver.quit();   driver.quit()     Quit will:  Close all the windows and tabs associated with that WebDriver session The browser process The background driver process Notify Selenium Grid that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session (if you are using Selenium Grid)   Failure to call quit will leave extra background processes and ports running on your machine which could cause you problems later.\nSome test frameworks offer methods and annotations which you can hook into to tear down at the end of a test.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll public static void tearDown() { driver.quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /* Example using Visual Studio\u0026#39;s UnitTesting https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.aspx */ [TestCleanup] public void TearDown() { driver.Quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /** * Example using Mocha * https://mochajs.org/#hooks */ after(\u0026#39;Tear down\u0026#39;, async function () { await driver.quit(); });   /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll fun tearDown() { driver.quit() }     If not running WebDriver in a test context, you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit(); }   try: #WebDriver code here... finally: driver.quit()   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.Quit(); }   begin #WebDriver code here... ensure driver.quit end   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { await driver.quit(); }   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit() }     Python\u0026rsquo;s WebDriver now supports the python context manager, which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution.\nwith webdriver.Firefox() as driver: # WebDriver code here... # WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation Frames and Iframes Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain. You are unlikely to work with them unless you are working with an pre HTML5 webapp. Iframes allow the insertion of a document from an entirely different domain, and are still commonly used.\nIf you need to work with frames or iframes, Webdriver allows you to work with them in the same way. Consider a button within an iframe. If we inspect the element using the browser development tools, we might see the following:\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;modal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe id=\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/iframe.html\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Click here\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the iframe we would expect to click on the button using something like:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # This Wont work driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # This won\u0026#39;t work driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // This won\u0026#39;t work await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     However, if there are no buttons outside of the iframe, you might instead get a no such element error. This happens because Selenium is only aware of the elements in the top level document. To interact with the button, we will need to first switch to the frame, in a similar way to how we switch windows. WebDriver offers three ways of switching to a frame.\nUsing a WebElement Switching using a WebElement is the most flexible option. You can find the frame using your preferred selector and switch to it.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Store the web element WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # Store iframe web element iframe = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#34;) # switch to selected iframe driver.switch_to.frame(iframe) # Now click on button driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //Store the web element IWebElement iframe = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # Store iframe web element iframe = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#39;) # Switch to the frame driver.switch_to.frame iframe # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // Store the web element const iframe = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#39;)); // Switch to the frame await driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //Store the web element WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)) //Switch to the frame driver.switchTo().frame(iframe) //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     Using a name or ID If your frame or iframe has an id or name attribute, this can be used instead. If the name or ID is not unique on the page, then the first one found will be switched to.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Using the ID driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # Switch frame by id driver.switch_to.frame(\u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39;) # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //Using the ID driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # Switch by ID driver.switch_to.frame \u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39; # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // Using the ID await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39;); // Or using the name instead await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;myframe\u0026#39;); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //Using the ID driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;) //Or using the name instead driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;) //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     Using an index It is also possible to use the index of the frame, such as can be queried using window.frames in JavaScript.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Switches to the second frame driver.switchTo().frame(1);   # Switch to the second frame driver.switch_to.frame(1)   // Switches to the second frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(1);   # switching to second iframe based on index iframe = driver.find_elements_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;)[1] # switch to selected iframe driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)   // Switches to the second frame await driver.switchTo().frame(1);   // Switches to the second frame driver.switchTo().frame(1)     Leaving a frame To leave an iframe or frameset, switch back to the default content like so:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return to the top level driver.switchTo().defaultContent();   # switch back to default content driver.switch_to.default_content()   // Return to the top level driver.SwitchTo().DefaultContent();   # Return to the top level driver.switch_to.default_content   // Return to the top level await driver.switchTo().defaultContent();   // Return to the top level driver.switchTo().defaultContent()     Window management Screen resolution can impact how your web application renders, so WebDriver provides mechanisms for moving and resizing the browser window.\nGet window size Fetches the size of the browser window in pixels.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.manage().window().getSize().getWidth(); int height = driver.manage().window().getSize().getHeight(); //Or store the dimensions and query them later Dimension size = driver.manage().window().getSize(); int width1 = size.getWidth(); int height1 = size.getHeight();   # Access each dimension individually width = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;) # Or store the dimensions and query them later size = driver.get_window_size() width1 = size.get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height1 = size.get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;)   //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Width; int height = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Height; //Or store the dimensions and query them later System.Drawing.Size size = driver.Manage().Window.Size; int width1 = size.Width; int height1 = size.Height;   # Access each dimension individually width = driver.manage.window.size.width height = driver.manage.window.size.height # Or store the dimensions and query them later size = driver.manage.window.size width1 = size.width height1 = size.height   // Access each dimension individually const { width, height } = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later const rect = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); const width1 = rect.width; const height1 = rect.height;   //Access each dimension individually val width = driver.manage().window().getSize().getWidth() val height = driver.manage().window().getSize().getHeight() //Or store the dimensions and query them later val size = driver.manage().window().getSize() val width1 = size.getWidth() val height1 = size.getHeight()     Set window size Restores the window and sets the window size. Java Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1024, 768));  driver.set_window_size(1024, 768)  driver.Manage().Window.Size = new Size(1024, 768);   driver.manage.window.resize_to(1024,768)  await driver.manage().window().setRect({ width: 1024, height: 768 });   driver.manage().window().size(Dimension(1024, 768))   \nGet window position Fetches the coordinates of the top left coordinate of the browser window.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Access each dimension individually int x = driver.manage().window().getPosition().getX(); int y = driver.manage().window().getPosition().getY(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later Point position = driver.manage().window().getPosition(); int x1 = position.getX(); int y1 = position.getY();   # Access each dimension individually x = driver.get_window_position().get(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;) y = driver.get_window_position().get(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) # Or store the dimensions and query them later position = driver.get_window_position() x1 = position.get(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;) y1 = position.get(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;)   //Access each dimension individually int x = driver.Manage().Window.Position.X; int y = driver.Manage().Window.Position.Y; //Or store the dimensions and query them later Point position = driver.Manage().Window.Position; int x1 = position.X; int y1 = position.Y;   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Access each dimension individually const { x, y } = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later const rect = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); const x1 = rect.x; const y1 = rect.y;   // Access each dimension individually val x = driver.manage().window().position.x val y = driver.manage().window().position.y // Or store the dimensions and query them later val position = driver.manage().window().position val x1 = position.x int y1 = position.y     Set window position Moves the window to the chosen position.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.manage().window().setPosition(new Point(0, 0));   # Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.set_window_position(0, 0)   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.Manage().Window.Position = new Point(0, 0);   driver.manage.window.move_to(0,0)   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor await driver.manage().window().setRect({ x: 0, y: 0 });   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.manage().window().position = Point(0,0)     Maximise window Enlarges the window.

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n To use Selenium Grid, you need to maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes. As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort, many organizations use IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute to provide this infrastructure.\nOther options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud. It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware. This chapter will go into detail about the option of running your own grid, complete with its own node infrastructure.\nQuick start This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Grid Hub, and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node. We will also show you how to call the grid from Java. The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine, but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.\nThe selenium-server-standalone package includes the hub, WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the Grid, ant is not required anymore. You can download the selenium-server-standalone-.jar from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.\nStep 1: Start the Hub The Hub is the central point that will receive test requests and distribute them to the right nodes. The distribution is done on a capabilities basis, meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.\nBecause a test\u0026rsquo;s desired capabilities are just what the name implies, desired, the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone.jar file. You start the hub by passing the -role hub flag to the standalone server:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub The Hub will listen to port 4444 by default. You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to http://localhost:4444/grid/console.\nTo change the default port, you can add the optional -port flag with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command. Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below) are possible command-line flags.\nYou certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above, but if you need more advanced configuration, you can also specify a JSON format config file, for convenience, to configure the hub when you start it. You can do it like so:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug Below you will see an example of a hubConfig.json file. We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.\n{ \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;cleanupCycle\u0026#34;: 5000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 300000, \u0026#34;newSessionWaitTimeout\u0026#34;: -1, \u0026#34;servlets\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;prioritizer\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;capabilityMatcher\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;throwOnCapabilityNotPresent\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;nodePolling\u0026#34;: 180000, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;} Step 2: Start the Nodes Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality, or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality, or both at the same time, you use the same selenium-server-standalone.jar file to start the nodes:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444 If a port is not specified through the -port flag, a free port will be chosen. You can run multiple nodes on one machine but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory resources and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.\nConfiguration of Node with options As mentioned, for backwards compatibility “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role. But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.\nPassing JVM properties (using the -D flag before the -jar argument) on the command line as well, and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:\n-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe\nConfiguration of Node with JSON You can also start grid nodes that are configured with a JSON configuration file\njava -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json And here is an example of a nodeConfig.json file:\n{ \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;acceptSslCerts\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;javascriptEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;takesScreenshot\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;firefox_profile\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;browser-version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;firefox_binary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanSession\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chrome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;internet explorer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanUpCycle\u0026#34;: 2000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 30000, \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 5555, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;register\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;hubPort\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5 } } A note about the -host flag\nFor both hub and node, if the -host flag is not specified, 0.0.0.0 will be used by default. This will bind to all the public (non-loopback) IPv4 interfaces of the machine. If you have a special network configuration or any component that creates extra network interfaces, it is advised to set the -host flag with a value that allows the hub/node to be reachable from a different machine.\nSpecifying the port The default TCP/IP port used by the hub is 4444. If you need to change the port please use above mentioned configurations.\nTroubleshooting Using Log file For advanced troubleshooting you can specify a log file to log system messages. Start Selenium GRID hub or node with -log argument. Please see the below example:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -log log.txt Use your favorite text editor to open log file (log.txt in the example above) to find \u0026ldquo;ERROR\u0026rdquo; logs if you get issues.\nUsing -debug argument Also you can use -debug argument to print debug logs to console. Start Selenium Grid Hub or Node with -debug argument. Please see the below example:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -debug Warning The Selenium Grid must be protected from external access using appropriate firewall permissions.\nFailure to protect your Grid could result in one or more of the following occurring:\n You provide open access to your Grid infrastructure You allow third parties to access internal web applications and files You allow third parties to run custom binaries  See this blog post on Detectify, which gives a good overview of how a publicly exposed Grid could be misused: Don\u0026rsquo;t Leave your Grid Wide Open.\nDocker Selenium Docker provides a convenient way to provision and scale Selenium Grid infrastructure in a unit known as a container. Containers are standardised units of software that contain everything required to run the desired application, including all dependencies, in a reliable and repeatable way on different machines.\nThe Selenium project maintains a set of Docker images which you can download and run to get a working grid up and running quickly. Nodes are available for both Firefox and Chrome. Full details of how to provision a grid can be found within the Docker Selenium repository.\nPrerequisite The only requirement to run a Grid is to have Docker installed and working. Install Docker.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Acceptance testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature matches its requirements. This generally involves the customer\u0026rsquo;s feedback or specification.\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behavior. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.\nFunctional testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature functions properly, without issues.\nThis generally include: the tests work without errors (404, exceptions\u0026hellip;), in an usable way (right redirections),\nin an accessible way and matching its specifications\n(see acceptance testing above).\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating expected returns.\nThis simulation could be done by record/playback or through\nthe different supported languages as explainedin this documentation.\nPerformance testing As its name indicates, performance tests are done in order to measure how well an application is performing.\nThere are two main sub-types for performance testing:\nLoad testing Load testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under different defined loads (usually a particular number of users connected at once)\nStress testing Stress testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under stress (or above the maximum supported load).\nGenerally, performance tests are done by executing a number of Selenium written tests simulating different users hitting a particular function on the web app and retrieving some meaningful measurements.\nThis is generally done by other tools that retrieve the metrics. One such tools is JMeter.\nFor a web application, details to measure include: throughput, latency, data loss, individual component loading times\u0026hellip;\nNote: All browsers have a performance tab in their developers\u0026rsquo; tools section (accessible by pressing F12)\nNote 2: is a subtype of non-functional testing as this is generally measured per system and not per function/feature.\nRegression testing This testing is generally done after a change, fix or feature addition.\nIn order to ensure that the change has not broken any of the existing functionality, some already executed tests are executed again.\nThe set of re-executed test can be full or partial and can include several different types, depending on the application and development team.\nTest driven development (TDD) Rather than a test type per se, TDD is an iterative development methodology in which tests drive the design of a feature.\nEach cycle starts by creating a set of unit tests that the feature should pass (which should fail their first time executed).\nAfter this, development takes place in order to make the tests pass. The tests are executed again starting another cycle and this process continues until all tests are passing.\nThis aims to speed up the development of an application based on the fact that defects are less costly the earlier they are found.\nBehavior-driven development (BDD) BDD is also an iterative development methodology based on above (TDD) in which the goal is to involve all the parties in the development of an application.\nEach cycle starts by creating some specification (which should fail). Then create the failing unit tests (which should also fail) and then create the development.\nThis cycle is repeated until all type of tests are passing.\nIn order to do so, a specification language is used. It should be understandable by all parties and simple, standard and explicit. Most tools use Gherkin as this language.\nThe goal is to be able to detect even more errors than TDD by targeting potential acceptance errors too and make communication between parties smoother.\nA set of tools are currently available in order to write the specifications and match them with code functions, such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.\nA set of tools are built on top of Selenium to make this process even faster by directly transform the BDD specifications into executable code. Some of these are: JBehave, Capybara and Robot Framework.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n For multiple reasons, logging into sites like Gmail and Facebook using WebDriver is not recommended. Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.\nThe ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth. Although using an API might seem like a bit of extra hard work, you will be paid back in speed, reliability, and stability. The API is also unlikely to change whereas webpages and HTML locators change often and require you to update your test framework.\nLogging in to third party sites using WebDriver at any point of your test increases the risk of your test failing because it makes your test longer. A general rule of thumb is that longer tests are more fragile and unreliable.\nWebDriver implementations that are W3C conformant also annotate the navigator object with a webdriver property so that Denial of Service attacks can be mitigated.\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.\nFrom experience, most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver are connected to race conditions that occur between the browser and the user\u0026rsquo;s instructions. An example could be that the user instructs the browser to navigate to a page, then gets a no such element error when trying to find an element.\nConsider the following document:\n\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=utf-8\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Race Condition Example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var initialised = false; window.addEventListener(\u0026#34;load\u0026#34;, function() { var newElement = document.createElement(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); newElement.textContent = \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(newElement); initialised = true; }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The WebDriver instructions might look innocent enough:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.Text, \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox begin # Navigate to URL driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; # Get and store Paragraph Text search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert(element.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     The issue here is that the default page load strategy used in WebDriver listens for the document.readyState to change to \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot; before returning from the call to navigate. Because the p element is added after the document has completed loading, this WebDriver script might be intermittent. It “might” be intermittent because no guarantees can be made about elements or events that trigger asynchronously without explicitly waiting—or blocking—on those events.\nFortunately, using the normal instruction set available on the WebElement interface—such as WebElement.click and _WebElement.sendKeys_—are guaranteed to be synchronous, in that the function calls won\u0026rsquo;t return (or the callback won\u0026rsquo;t trigger in callback-style languages) until the command has been completed in the browser. The advanced user interaction APIs, Keyboard and Mouse, are exceptions as they are explicitly intended as “do what I say” asynchronous commands.\nWaiting is having the automated task execution elapse a certain amount of time before continuing with the next step.\nTo overcome the problem of race conditions between the browser and your WebDriver script, most Selenium clients ship with a wait package. When employing a wait, you are using what is commonly referred to as an explicit wait.\nExplicit wait Explicit waits are available to Selenium clients for imperative, procedural languages. They allow your code to halt program execution, or freeze the thread, until the condition you pass it resolves. The condition is called with a certain frequency until the timeout of the wait is elapsed. This means that for as long as the condition returns a falsy value, it will keep trying and waiting.\nSince explicit waits allow you to wait for a condition to occur, they make a good fit for synchronising the state between the browser and its DOM, and your WebDriver script.\nTo remedy our buggy instruction set from earlier, we could employ a wait to have the findElement call wait until the dynamically added element from the script has been added to the DOM:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER); // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds WebElement firstResult = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); // Print the first result System.out.println(firstResult.getText());   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait def document_initialised(driver): return driver.execute_script(\u0026#34;return initialised\u0026#34;) driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) WebDriverWait(driver).until(document_initialised) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.Url = \u0026#34;https://www.google.com/ncr\u0026#34;; driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).SendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.Enter); WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); IWebElement firstResult = wait.Until(e =\u0026gt; e.FindElement(By.XPath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); Console.WriteLine(firstResult.Text);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout =\u0026gt; 10) def document_initialised(driver) driver.execute_script(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;) end begin driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; wait.until{document_initialised driver} search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   const documentInitialised = () =\u0026gt; driver.executeScript(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;); await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); await driver.wait(() =\u0026gt; documentInitialised(), 10000); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;) driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER) // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds val firstResult = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))) // Print the first result println(firstResult.text)     We pass in the condition as a function reference that the wait will run repeatedly until its return value is truthy. A “truthful” return value is anything that evaluates to boolean true in the language at hand, such as a string, number, a boolean, an object (including a WebElement), or a populated (non-empty) sequence or list. That means an empty list evaluates to false. When the condition is truthful and the blocking wait is aborted, the return value from the condition becomes the return value of the wait.\nWith this knowledge, and because the wait utility ignores no such element errors by default, we can refactor our instructions to be more concise:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement foo = new WebDriverWait(driver, 3) .until(driver -\u0026gt; driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;))); assertEquals(foo.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = WebDriverWait(driver).until(lambda d: return d.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   using (var driver = new FirefoxDriver()) { var foo = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)) .Until(drv =\u0026gt; drv.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;))); Debug.Assert(foo.Text.Equals(\u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val ele = WebDriverWait(getWebDriver(), 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;))) assert(ele.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     In that example, we pass in an anonymous function (but we could also define it explicitly as we did earlier so it may be reused). The first and only argument that is passed to our condition is always a reference to our driver object, WebDriver (called d in the example). In a multi-threaded environment, you should be careful to operate on the driver reference passed in to the condition rather than the reference to the driver in the outer scope.\nBecause the wait will swallow no such element errors that are raised when the element isn\u0026rsquo;t found, the condition will retry until the element is found. Then it will take the return value, a WebElement, and pass it back through to our script.\nIf the condition fails, e.g. a truthful return value from the condition is never reached, the wait will throw/raise an error/exception called a timeout error.\nOptions The wait condition can be customised to match your needs. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary to wait the full extent of the default timeout, as the penalty for not hitting a successful condition can be expensive.\nThe wait lets you pass in an argument to override the timeout:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //new WebDriverWait(driver,3).until(some_condition(WebElement)) new WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=3).until(some_condition)   new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)).Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeClickable(By.XPath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)))     Expected conditions Because it\u0026rsquo;s quite a common occurrence to have to synchronise the DOM and your instructions, most clients also come with a set of predefined expected conditions. As might be obvious by the name, they are conditions that are predefined for frequent wait operations.\nThe conditions available in the different language bindings vary, but this is a non-exhaustive list of a few:\n alert is present element exists element is visible title contains title is element staleness visible text  You can refer to the API documentation for each client binding to find an exhaustive list of expected conditions:\n Java\u0026rsquo;s org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions class Python\u0026rsquo;s selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions class .NET\u0026rsquo;s OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.ExpectedConditions type  Implicit wait There is a second type of wait that is distinct from explicit wait called implicit wait. By implicitly waiting, WebDriver polls the DOM for a certain duration when trying to find any element. This can be useful when certain elements on the webpage are not available immediately and need some time to load.\nImplicit waiting for elements to appear is disabled by default and will need to be manually enabled on a per-session basis. Mixing explicit waits and implicit waits will cause unintended consequences, namely waits sleeping for the maximum time even if the element is available or condition is true.\nWarning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.\nAn implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0, meaning disabled. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;); WebElement myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;));   driver = Firefox() driver.implicitly_wait(10) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) my_dynamic_element = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;)   IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitWait = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); driver.Url = \u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;; IWebElement dynamicElement = driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;dynamicElement\u0026#34;));   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox driver.manage.timeouts.implicit_wait = 10 begin driver.get \u0026#39;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#39; search_form = driver.find_element(:id,\u0026#39;dynamic_element\u0026#39;) ensure driver.quit end   (async function(){ // Apply timeout for 10 seconds await driver.manage().setTimeouts( { implicit: 10000 } ); // Navigate to url await driver.get(\u0026#39;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#39;); let webElement = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;)); }());   val driver = FirefoxDriver() driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) val myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;))     FluentWait FluentWait instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the condition.\nUsers may configure the wait to ignore specific types of exceptions whilst waiting, such as NoSuchElementException when searching for an element on the page.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking // for its presence once every 5 seconds. Wait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt; wait = new FluentWait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt;(driver) .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5)) .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class); WebElement foo = wait.until(new Function\u0026lt;WebDriver, WebElement\u0026gt;() { public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) { return driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;)); } });   driver = Firefox() driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10, poll_frequency=1, ignored_exceptions=[ElementNotVisibleException, ElementNotSelectableException]) element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, \u0026#34;//div\u0026#34;)))   using (var driver = new FirefoxDriver()) { WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, timeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)) { PollingInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), }; wait.IgnoreExceptionTypes(typeof(NoSuchElementException)); var foo = wait.Until(drv =\u0026gt; drv.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;))); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val wait = FluentWait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt;(getWebDriver()) .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(3)) .ignoring(NoSuchElementException::class.java) val foo = wait.until {it.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;)) }     "

Driving a browser natively as a user would either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server, it marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.\nSelenium WebDriver fits in the same role as RC did, and has incorporated the original 1.x bindings. It refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver or sometimes as Selenium 2.\nSelenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0\n WebDriver is designed in a simpler and more concise programming interface along with addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API.\n WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API when compared to Selenium 1.0.\n It drives the browser much more effectively and overcomes the limitations of Selenium 1 that affected our functional test coverage, like the file upload or download, pop-ups, and dialogs barrier.\n WebDriver overcomes the limitation of Selenium RC\u0026rsquo;s single-host origin policy.\n  "

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup message offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.\nAlerts The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as the OK button. See an example alert.\nWebDriver can get the text from the popup and accept or dismiss these alerts.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable String text = alert.getText(); //Press the OK button alert.accept();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;).click() # Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable alert = wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present()) # Store the alert text in a variable text = alert.text # Press the OK button alert.accept()   //Click the link to activate the alert driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).Click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable IAlert alert = wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.AlertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable string text = alert.Text; //Press the OK button alert.Accept();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element(:link_text, \u0026#39;See an example alert\u0026#39;).click # Store the alert reference in a variable alert = driver.switch_to.alert # Store the alert text in a variable alert_text = alert.text # Press on OK button alert.accept   //Click the link to activate the alert await driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#39;See an example alert\u0026#39;)).click(); // Wait for the alert to be displayed await driver.wait(until.alertIsPresent()); // Store the alert in a variable let alert = await driver.switchTo().alert(); //Store the alert text in a variable let alertText = await alert.getText(); //Press the OK button await alert.accept(); // Note: To use await, the above code should be inside an async function    //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).click() //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable val alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()) //Store the alert text in a variable val text = alert.getText() //Press the OK button alert.accept()     Confirm A confirm box is similar to an alert, except the user can also choose to cancel the message.

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is generally not advised. Not because it is incapable but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.\nIt may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself. Variation at these points will cause variation in your results. It is difficult to separate the difference between the performance of your website and the performance of external resources, and it is also hard to tell what the performance penalty is for using WebDriver in the browser, especially if you are injecting scripts.\nThe other potential attraction is \u0026ldquo;saving time\u0026rdquo; — carrying out functional and performance tests at the same time. However, functional and performance tests have opposing objectives. To test functionality, a tester may need to be patient and wait for loading, but this will cloud the performance testing results and vice versa.\nTo improve the performance of your website, you will need to be able to analyse overall performance independent of environment differences, identify poor code practices, breakdown of performance of individual resources (i.e. CSS or JavaScript) in order to know what to improve. There are performance testing tools available that can do this job already, and which provide reporting and analysis which can even make improvement suggestions.\nExample (open source) packages to use are: JMeter\n"

Write the tests in a way that will not be reliant on other tests to complete:\nLet us say there is a content management system with which you can create some custom content which then appears on your website as a module after publishing, and it may take some time to sync between the CMS and the application.\nA wrong way of testing your module is that the content is created and published in one test, and then checking the module in another test. This is not feasible as the content may not be available immediately for the other test after publishing.\nInstead, you can create a stub content which can be turned on and off within the affected test, and use that for validating the module. However, for content creation, you can still have a separate test.\n"

No one approach works for all situations. We prefer the idea of \u0026ldquo;Guidelines and Recommendations\u0026rdquo;. We encourage you to read through these and thoughtfully decide what approaches will work for you in your particular environment.\nFunctional testing is difficult to get right for many reasons. As if application state, complexity, and dependencies do not make testing difficult enough, dealing with browsers (especially with cross-browser incompatibilities) makes writing good tests a challenge.\nSelenium provides tools to make functional user interaction easier, but does not help you write well-architected test suites. In this chapter we offer advice, guidelines, and recommendations. on how to approach functional web page automation.\nThis chapter records software design patterns popular amongst many of the users of Selenium that have proven successful over the years.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Using WebDriver to spider through links is not a recommended practice not because it cannot be done, but because it’s definitely not the most ideal tool. WebDriver needs time to start up, and can take several seconds up to a minute depending on how your test is written, just to get to the page and traverse through the DOM.\nInstead of using WebDriver for this, you could save a ton of time by executing a curl command, or using a library such as BeautifulSoup since these methods don’t rely on creating a browser and navigating to a page.

Tests contact the hub to obtain access to remote browser instances. The hub has a list of registered servers that it provides access to, and allows control of these instances.\nSelenium Grid allows us to run tests in parallel on multiple machines, and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally (instead of in each individual test).\nSelenium Grid is not a silver bullet.

C\u0026rsquo;est un effort continu (sans cible de release spécifique) dans le but de fournir un manuel à jour sur l\u0026rsquo;utilisation effective de Selenium. Nous espérons rappatrier les parties de l\u0026rsquo;ancienne documentation lorsque nécessaire.\nLes contributions à cette nouvelle documentation suivent le process décrit dans la section Contribution ci-dessous. Il est recommandé de se familiariser avec la documentation en enlisant un peu plus ici.\nLe projet Selenium accueille tout type de contribution. Voici les différentes aides que vous pouvez apporter:\nSignaler un problème Lorsque vous signalez une nouveau issue ou en commentez une existante, merci de vous assurer que la discussion se concentre sur des problèmes techniques concrets liés à Selenium et/ou sa documentation.\nTous les composants de Selenium évoluent assez rapidement au cours du temps, ce qui peut engendrer une documentation dépassée. Si cela se trouve être le cas, comme mentionné précédemment n\u0026rsquo;hésitez pas à créer une issue. Il se peut que vous souhaitiez également contribuer à mettre à jour la documentation, dans ce cas envoyez nous une pull request avec les modifications associées.\nSi vous avez un doute sur la réalité d\u0026rsquo;un problème que vous rencontrez, merci de d\u0026rsquo;abord poser la question à la mailing list selenium-users@, ou de nous rejoindre sur le canal #selenium sur irc.freenode.org ou Slack.\nContributions Le projet Selenium appécie les nouveaux contributeurs. Les personnes contribuant de façon significative et répétée dans le temps sont promus Committers et ont un commit-access sur le projet.\nCe document va vous guider à travers le process de contribution.\nEtape 1: Fork Forker le projet sur Github et faites un check out sur votre copie locale.\n% git clone git@github.com:username/docs.git % cd docs % git remote add upstream git://github.com/seleniumhq/docs.git Dépendences: Hugo La documentation utilise Hugo afin de construire et afficher le site. Afin de tester localement avant de commiter tout changement, merci d\u0026rsquo;installer Hugo et de démarrer le serveur local pour afficher le site en local.\nEtape 2: Branch Créez une branche pour votre fonctionnalité et commencez à faire vos modifications:\n% git checkout -b my-feature-branch Nous utilisons un développement basé sur le HEAD, ce qui veut dire que tous les changements sont appliqués directement sur le master.\nEtape 3: Commit Assurez-vous d\u0026rsquo;abord que git connaisse votre nom et votre adresse mail:\n% git config --global user.name \u0026#39;Santa Claus\u0026#39; % git config --global user.email \u0026#39;santa@example.com\u0026#39; Ecrire de bon message de commit est important. Un message de commit devrait décrire le changement, la raison du changement, et référencer les issues corrigées (si nécessaire). Suivez les lignes directrices suivantes:\n La première ligne devrait faire approximativement 50 caractères ou moins et contenir une description courte du changement La seoncde ligne doit rester vide Retourner à la ligne à la colonne 72 pour chaque ligne du corps du message Inclure Fixes #N, lorsque nécessaire. Où N est le numéro de li\u0026rsquo;ssue que le commit corrige  Un bon message de commit peut ressembler à ceci:\nexplique le commit en une ligne Corps du commit de message constitué de quelques lignes, expliquant les choses de façon plus détaillé, contextualisant si besoin le problème corrigé, etc. Le corps du message peut être constitué de plusieurs paragraphes. Et encore merci de garder des lignes de moins de 72 caractères. Grâce à cela, la sortie de `git log` restera propre même avec indentation. Fixes #141 La première ligne doit être la plus parlante possible, c\u0026rsquo;est ce que les gens verront lors d\u0026rsquo;un git shortlog ou git log --oneline.\nEtape 4: Rebase Faites un git rebase (et non pas git merge) afin de synchroniser votre travail de temps en temps.\n% git fetch upstream % git rebase upstream/master Etape 5: Test Rappelez-vous bien de toujours lancer le serveur local, pour vous assurez que vos changements non rien cassé.\nEtape 6: Traduction Si vous mettez à jour des infos, en ajouter de nouvelles, ou supprimer des infos obsolètes, merci de garder la traduction à jour également. Bien sûr il est possible que vous ne parliez pas toutes les langues disponibles. Dans ce cas, créez une nouvelle issue dans laquelle vous décrivez clairement que telle partie de la documentation a évolué et qu\u0026rsquo;une traduction est nécessaire. De cette manière, un contributeur parlant une des langues disponibles pourra intervenir et nous aider à garder la traduction à jour.\nEtape 7: Signer le CLA Avant que nous puissions accepter, nous vous demandons de signer un Contributor License Agreement (ou CLA). Et ce afin de nous assurer que les contributeurs ont le droit de céder leur code.\nLorsque vous ouvrez votre pull request, nous vous demandons d\u0026rsquo;indiquer que vous avez signé le CLA. Cela réduira d\u0026rsquo;autant le temps d\u0026rsquo;intégration de votre demande.\nEtape 8: Push % git push origin my-feature-branch Rendez-vous sur https://github.com/yourusername/site.git et cliquez sur le bouton Pull Request et remplissez le formulaire. Merci d\u0026rsquo;indiquer que vous avez signé le CLA (voir Etape 7).\nLes Pull Requests sont généralement traitées en quelques jours. Si il y a des commentaires à prendre en compte de votre part, appliquer vos modifications dans de nouveaux commits (de préférence via fixups) et faites un push sur la même branche.\nEtape 9: Intégration Lorsque la revue de code est terminée, un commiter intégrera votre PR sur la branche gh-pages de la documentation. Comme nous aimons garder un historique linéraire de la branche master, nous ferons normalement un squash et rebase de l\u0026rsquo;historique de votre branche.\nCommunication Les contributeurs Selenium fréquentent le canal #selenium sur irc.freenode.org ou sur Slack. vous pouvez également rejoindre la mailing list selenium-developers@.\n"

Voici par exemple une des plus simples instructions disponibles:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.By; import org.openqa.selenium.Keys; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement; import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WebDriverWait; import static org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated; public class HelloSelenium { public static void main(String[] args) { WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10); try { driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER); WebElement firstResult = wait.until(presenceOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#34;))); System.out.println(firstResult.getAttribute(\u0026#34;textContent\u0026#34;)); } finally { driver.quit(); } } }   from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions import presence_of_element_located #Cet exemple requiert Selenium WebDriver 3.13 ou plus récent with webdriver.Firefox() as driver: wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;) driver.find_element_by_name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;).send_keys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.RETURN) first_result = wait.until(presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, \u0026#34;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#34;))) print(first_result.get_attribute(\u0026#34;textContent\u0026#34;))   using System; using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; using OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI; using SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers; class HelloSelenium { static void Main() { using (IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver()) { WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;https://www.google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).SendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.Enter); IWebElement firstResult = wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementExists(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#34;))); Console.WriteLine(firstResult.GetAttribute(\u0026#34;textContent\u0026#34;)); } } }   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(timeout: 10) begin driver.get \u0026#39;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#39; driver.find_element(name: \u0026#39;q\u0026#39;).send_keys \u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;, :return first_result = wait.until { driver.find_element(css: \u0026#39;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#39;) } puts first_result.attribute(\u0026#39;textContent\u0026#39;) ensure driver.quit end   const {Builder, By, Key, until} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function example() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;firefox\u0026#39;).build(); try { // Navigate to Url  await driver.get(\u0026#39;https://www.google.com\u0026#39;); // Enter text \u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; and perform keyboard action \u0026#34;Enter\u0026#34;  await driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#39;q\u0026#39;)).sendKeys(\u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;, Key.ENTER); let firstResult = await driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.css(\u0026#39;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#39;)), 10000); console.log(await firstResult.getAttribute(\u0026#39;textContent\u0026#39;)); } finally{ driver.quit(); } })();   import org.openqa.selenium.By import org.openqa.selenium.Keys import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WebDriverWait import static org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated class HelloSelenium { public main(args: Array\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;) { val driver = new FirefoxDriver() val wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10) try { driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;) driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER) val firstResult = wait.until(presenceOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;h3\u0026gt;div\u0026#34;))) System.out.println(firstResult.getAttribute(\u0026#34;textContent\u0026#34;)) } finally { driver.quit() } } }     Suivez le Quick Tour pour une explication complète de ce qu\u0026rsquo;il se passe derrière ces exemples de code. Il est conseillé de poursuivre cette documentation narrative afin de voir comment installer et utiliser Selenium en tant qu\u0026rsquo;outil d\u0026rsquo;automatisation de test, ainsi que pour mettre à l\u0026rsquo;echelle l\u0026rsquo;exécution de tels tests sur de larges environnements distribués, avec de multiples navigateurs et des systèmes d\u0026rsquo;exploitation différents.\nGetting started Si Selenium est nouveau pour vous, nous vous proposons quelques ressources qui pourront vous aider à vous mettre à niveau très rapidement.\n Tour rapide  WebDriver Remote Control IDE Grid HTML Runner   "

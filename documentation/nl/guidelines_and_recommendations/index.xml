 Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page.</description>

 A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.
Your users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics.</description>

 Selenium should not be used to prepare a test case. All repetitive actions and preparations for a test case, should be done through other methods. For example, most web UIs have authentication (e.g. a login form). Eliminating logging in via web browser before every test will improve both the speed and stability of the test.</description>

 Eliminating the dependencies on external services will greatly improve the speed and stability of your tests.</description>

 Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit test frameworks is a good start. Most unit test frameworks have reports that can generate xUnit or HTML formatted reports. xUnit reports are popular for importing results to a Continuous Integration (CI) server like Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, etc.</description>

 Although mentioned in several places it is worth mentioning again. Ensure tests are isolated from one another.
  Do not share test data. Imagine several tests that each query the database for valid orders before picking one to perform an action on. Should two tests pick up the same order you are likely to get unexpected behaviour.</description>

 Write each test as its own unit. Write the tests in a way that will not be reliant on other tests to complete:
Let us say there is a content management system with which you can create some custom content which then appears on your website as a module after publishing, and it may take some time to sync between the CMS and the application.</description>

      <title>Consider using a fluent API</title>

 Martin Fowler coined the term &amp;ldquo;Fluent API&amp;rdquo;. Selenium already implements something like this in their FluentWait class, which is meant as an alternative to the standard Waitclass. You could enable the Fluent API design pattern in your page object and then query the Google search page with a code snippet like this one:</description>

 Start each test from a clean known state. Ideally, spin up a new virtual machine for each test. If spinning up a new virtual machine is not practical, at least start a new WebDriver for each test. For Firefox, start a WebDriver with your known profile.
FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(new File(&amp;#34;pathToFirefoxProfile&amp;#34;)); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile); </description>

To run your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browser, and browsers running on different operating systems. To reduce the time it takes for the test suite to complete a test pass. Grid is used to speed up the execution of a test pass by using multiple machines to run tests in parallel. For example, if you have a suite of 100 tests, but you set up Grid to support 4 different machines (VMs or separate physical machines) to run those tests, your test suite will complete in (roughly) one-fourth the time as it would if you ran your tests sequentially on a single machine.</description></item></channel></rss>

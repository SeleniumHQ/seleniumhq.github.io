      <description>Capitalisation of titles One should avoid title capitalisation, such as A Very Fine Heading, and instead go for A very fine heading. Gratutious capitalisation, or title case, often show a misunderstanding of – or a disregard for – orthographic conventions. We prefer what is known as sentence case, with a single initial capital to start headers.
Line length When editing the documentation’s source, which is written in plain HTML, limit your line lengths to around 72 characters.</description>

      <p>
        The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">Official User Group</a>.
        Here, you'll find that most of the time, someone already found the problem you
        are facing right now, and usually reached the solution for which you are looking.
      </p>
      <p class="font-italic">
        Note: Please make sure to search the group before asking for something. Your
        question likely won't get answered if it was previously answered in another
        discussion!

        The best place to ask for help is the user group (because they also keep the
        information accessible for others to read in the future). However, if you have
        a very important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can
        always enter the IRC
        <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat/#selenium">chat room</a>.
        You might just find someone ready to help on #selenium at Libera Chat
        (irc.libera.chat). There is more info about IRC on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">Wikipedia</a>.

      <p>If you would prefer to use Matrix then you can do that by joining the Selenium HQ Space
        <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#selenium:matrix.org">Selenium</a> channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option, if you prefer, is to use the 
        <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/seleniumhq/shared_invite/zt-2stlcmc6b-Hww~3r3yAzquhSq4riOFxA">

        Selenium is a diverse project and many commercial services have sprouted

        developing with Selenium.

      <p>
        Learning how to use Selenium effectively can be a taxing task. There
        are various companies who offer Selenium training.

        <span class="fw-bold">There is no officially recognised Selenium certification available</span>,
        and the project developers strongly believe that certification is of no real benefit
        to individuals or the industry. We have not authorized anyone to offer "official"
        Selenium certification and anyone who claims to offer it is misusing the Selenium
        project's trademark.

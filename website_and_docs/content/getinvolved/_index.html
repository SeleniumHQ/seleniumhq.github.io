    Selenium is certainly a team effort! There are several ways you can help out, whether you are a
    programmer, designer, QA engineer, writer, project manager, or just willing to help. If you are
    interested in helping, the best way to connect with us is at the Selenium Developers Group.
    We will work with you to get you set up to contribute.

        to answer a question or two, that would be great! There are often some very

It has been a great year for the Selenium community as it continues to grow. The popularity of Selenium’s Python Bindings is evident from the discussions at the Selenium Conference and on LinkedIn, while the Java bindings have impressively surpassed 100 million downloads.

This project, having reached 20 years old this year, would not be possible without the amazing contributions from our volunteer contributors and the Open Source Program Offices of companies like BrowserStack that allow us to work on this project as part of our day jobs.

**About BrowserStack**
They have over 50,000 organizations and 6M users using their end-to-end testing platform. BrowserStack has been one of the Selenium project's biggest supporters for years and currently employs several of Selenium's core maintainers, donating a significant portion of their time towards the development, maintenance, support, and leadership of open-source Selenium repos.

This dedicated support has allowed us to continue work on the client bindings, especially the work going into WebDriver BiDi, support our community, continuously improve our documentation, and maintain all the extra projects we oversee, ensuring Selenium can continue to thrive for the next 20 years.
We are also thrilled to highlight the collaborative efforts between the BrowserStack team, the Google Chrome team, Microsoft, Apple, SauceLabs, and the Firefox team, who have come together to build Selenium WebDriver BiDi, the next generation of Selenium. This collaborative spirit embodies our dedication to enhancing the testing experience for the Selenium user community.
With this in mind, the Selenium Project now shows our appreciation to BrowserStack for their years of continued support by creating a new sponsorship tier called the Development Partner.
We are deeply indebted to BrowserStack for all their support and are proud to recognize them as our first official Development Partner. This work has allowed us to continue progress on the client bindings, especially the work going into WebDriver BiDi, support our community, continuously improve our documentation, and maintain all the extra projects we oversee, so Selenium can continue to be around for the next 20 years!

### Tickets
Noted that quite a few outstanding Python PRs and need to make sure they get evaluated in a timely manner.

### Patch releases are all tagged
It is difficult to know which commits have been released and which haven't. For that, all patched releases
have now a tag in the format `selenium-4.x.y-lang`.

### Chrome Version Support Status (Chrome 101 released 4/26);
Patch releases all languages will be done and this should be up to date, supporting v101 before the next
TLC  meeting.

### Tagging Patches
It is difficult to know which commits have been released and which haven't. Agreed to start doing patch releases
in the format `selenium-4.x.y-lang`

### Leadership Updates

Regarding our [Governance docs](https://www.selenium.dev/project/governance/#consensus-seeking-process), about 
leadership changes and it refers to a "moderator" and "agenda item," as part of the process. The following items
were moderated by [titusfortner] and [diemol].


#### TLC

* Add [harsha509] and remove [barancev] from TLC (In the past 14 months Sri has 60 commits in the project and 
  another 99 in the docs)

Relevant items from the Governance documente regarding the above item:
* Add person to TLC:
  * A Committer is invited to become a TLC member by existing TLC members. A nomination will result in 
  discussion and then a decision by the TLC.
* Remove person from TLC:
  * A TLC member may be removed from the TLC by voluntary resignation, or by a standard TLC or PLC motion.

#### PLC

* Add [wcmcgee] to the PLC
* Bill has recently left Sauce Labs and is interested in joining the Selenium team officially. 
  Among other things, he has some ideas around improving Selenium marketing strategy, and he's in a 
  position where he can spend a lot of time working on things for us.

Relevant items from the Governance documente regarding the above item:

* Add person to PLC:
  * The existing PLC consults with the TLC and the active Committers, who will seek a decision based on a 
  Consensus Seeking Process to add or not those people.


### Selenium 4.2 & Selenium 4.3
On the agenda for future consideration, was not discussed in meeting due to lack of time.

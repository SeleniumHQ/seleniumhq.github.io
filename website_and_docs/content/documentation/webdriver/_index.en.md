WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally
or on a remote machine using the Selenium server.
It marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.

Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings
and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code.
This is commonly referred to as just _WebDriver_.

Selenium WebDriver is a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/)

* WebDriver is designed as a simple
  and more concise programming interface.

* WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API.

* It drives the browser effectively.

WebDriver is a large project: if we tried to push everything into a single monolithic build file it eventually becomes unmanageable. We know this. We've tried it. So we broke the single Rakefile into a series of `build.desc` files. Each of these describe a part of the build.

Let's take a look at a build.desc file. This is part of the [main test build.desc](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/build.desc):

```
java_test(name = "single",
  srcs = [
    "SingleTestSuite.java",
  ],
  deps = [
    ":tests",
    "//java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server",
    "//java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/v1:selenium-backed-webdriver-test",
    "//java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/firefox:test",
  ]  ])

```

## Targets

This highlights most of the key concepts. Firstly, it declares **target**, in this case there is a single `java_test` target.
Each target has a `name` attribute.

### Target Names

The combination of the location of the "build.desc" file and the name are used to derive the rake tasks that are generated. All task names are prefixed with "//" followed by the path to the directory containing the "build.desc" file relative to the `Rakefile`, followed by a ":" and then the name of the target within the "build.desc". An example makes this far clearer :)

The rake task generated by this example is `//java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium:single`

### Short Target Names

As a shortcut, if a target is named after the directory containing the "build.desc" file, you can omit the part of the rake task name after the colon. In our example: `//java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server` is the same as `//java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server:server`.

### Implicit Targets

Some build rules supply implicit targets, and provide related extensions to a normal build target. Examples include generating archives of source code, or running tests. These are declared by appending a further colon and the name of the implicit target to the full name of a build rule. In our example, you could run the tests using "//java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium:single:run"

Each of the rules described below have a list of implicit targets that are associated with them.

### Outputs

Each target specified in a "build.desc" file produces one and only one output. This is important. Keep it in mind. Generally, all output files are placed in the "build" directory, relative to the rake task name. In our example, the output of "//java/org/openqa/selenium/server" would be found in "build/java/org/openqa/selenium/server.jar". Build rules should output the names and locations of any files that they generate.

### Dependencies

Take a look at the "deps" section of the "single" target above. The `":tests"` is a reference to a target in the current "build.desc" file, in this case, it's a "java\_library" target immediately above. You'll also see that there's a reference to several full paths. For example `"//java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server"` This refers to another target defined in a crazy fun build.desc file.

### Browsers

The py\_test and js\_test rules have special handling for running the same tests in multiple browsers.  Relevant browser-specific meta-data is held in rake-tasks/browsers.rb.  The general way to use this is to append `_`browsername to the target name; without the `_`browsername suffix, the tests will be run for all browsers.

As an example, if we had a js\_test rule //foo/bar, we would run its tests in firefox by running the target //foo/bar\_ff:run or we would run in all available browsers by running the target //foo/bar:run

## Build Targets
You can list all the build targets using the `-T` option. e.g.
```
./go -T
```

Being a brief description of the available targets that you can use.

Note: When building a new library for the first time, the build will succeed but copying to pre-built will fail with a similar message:

```
cp build/cpp/amd64/libimetesthandler64.so 
go aborted!
can't convert nil into String
```

Solution: Copy the just-built library to the appropriate prebuilt folder (cpp/prebuilt/arch/).

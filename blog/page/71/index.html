<br />
<i>A great message I got from the screencasts is that your tests should tell a story. You compose that narrative in steps, so as to not trip yourself up. Many times you are probably required to develop against a backend service or directly with a database. So that’s how the story starts. Hello Mr. Database, are you there?

                <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/"><h2>The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</h2></a>
                <p>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better &#8212; in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.</p>
<p>And then the confusion began. Let&#8217;s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.03; when is the 1.0.4 release?</em></dt>
<dd>Se-RC 1.0.4 is planned for sometime towards the end of July 2010</dd>
<dt><em>I&#8217;ve heard rumours that 1.0.4 the to be the final release?</em></dt>
<dd>Yes. 1.0.4 is <em>planned</em> on being the final 1.x release</dd>
<dt><em>That&#8217;s crazy talk! I can&#8217;t use a .0 or &#8216;alpha&#8217; release for my mission critical application</em></dt>
<dd>Actually, its not all <em>that</em> crazy &#8212; and needs a bit more explanation. Se2 is truly a merger of the two projects, in fact 2.0a1 was literally the Se code from the OpenQA repository and the WebDriver code its Google Code repository merged into a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium">new one</a>. This meant that from the first release of the 2.x series, it has contained 100% of the 1.x code which means 100% backwards compatibility. Later releases in the 2.x series have been driven primarily by evolutions of the code that came from WebDriver, <em>not from Se 1.x</em>.</dd>
<dt><em>OK, so 100% of Se 1.x is in 2.x; I get that. But how are you making sure that fixes to one get into the other?</em></dt>
<dd>Here is another &#8216;secret&#8217; &#8212; don&#8217;t tell anyone, but there hasn&#8217;t been any pure 1.x development since the merging of the codebases. Every 1.x release since the merger has really been a 2.x release &#8212; but all packaged up to make it look like a 1.x release. This is why observant people have noticed a log message that looks something like <em>11:09:37.507 INFO &#8211; v2.0 [a4], with Core v2.0 [a4]</em> when they start up their 1.x server.</dd>
<dt><em>So you&#8217;ve been releasing <em>alpha</em> code disguised as a stable release? Jerks!</em></dt>
<dd>Woah! Relax! Recall what I said above about it being backwards compatible by default. The &#8216;alpha&#8217; tag is there because the API for the new code is still being developed and features flushed out. The 1.x code is however, still stable and still production quality.</dd>
<dt><em>Alright, I take back calling you folks jerks, but I really don&#8217;t like the alpha tag. When will it be out of &#8216;alpha&#8217;?</em></dt>
<dd>There is only one or two more features to implement (like handling alerts) in the WebDriver code and some cleanup before the betas start. But hope for a 2.0.0 final by the end of the year. And while we&#8217;re on the topic of &#8216;alpha&#8217; vs. &#8216;beta&#8217;, this the team&#8217;s working definitions of each.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alpha</em> &#8211; APIs can, and likely will change. Possibly in dramatic ways.</li>
<li><em>Beta</em> &#8211; With the APIs set, make sure they work with the major browsers</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><em>&#8216;Major Browsers&#8217; eh, what exactly does that mean?</em></dt>
<dd>Right now it means Firefox, Internet Explorer and at least one WebKit based one (Safari or Chrome)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In short&#8230; it is a requirement of Se2 that the server be backwards compatible with Se-RC 1.x and that has already been accomplished by building the code from a common source repository. This means that if you are using Se-RC, you can switch out the server for a 2.x one and have no impact on the execution of the scripts. <em>Plus</em> you can start to experiment with the new stuff that came over from WebDriver.</p>

                <p><p>12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that&#8217;s my excuse and I&#8217;m sticking with it. Enjoy. I&#8217;m going for a nap.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The big news this week was the <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/selenium-2-0a5-released/">next alpha of Se 2 came out</a>. Time to update those automation machines.</li>
<li>Like TestNG&#8217;s @BeforeClass and @AfterClass but using JUnit4? <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/07/17/using-junit-nested-suites-with-selenium-rc-to-simulate-testng-suite-and-grouping-annotations/">Using JUnit Nested Suites with Selenium RC to simulate TestNG suite and grouping annotations</a> is a long titled post, but describes how to fake one out to act like the other.</li>
<li>Also on the topic of TestNG is the announcement of <a href="http://www.nabeelalimemon.com/blog/2010/07/selenium-on-testng/">Selenium on TestNG</a></li>
<li>The folks at ActiveState did a survey in their community about tooling and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/07/survey-says-selenium-nose-most-popular-test-framework">Selenium won</a></li>
<li>I had to hack DNS a bit for a client&#8217;s Se setup to work the other week, but that seems pretty kludgey compared to <a href="http://twasink.net/blog/2010/07/selenium-trick-using-a-different-dns/">Selenium Trick: Using a different DNS</a></li>
<li>Using ExtJS? According to <a href="http://www.jslog.com/testing-extjs-with-selenium-automating-ui-tests">Testing ExtJS with Selenium Automating UI Tests</a> the trick is to use CSS as your location strategy</li>
<li>Jason Huggins was interviewed by Matt Heusser in <a href="http://www.softwaretestpro.com:80/Item/4832">Episode 3 of TWiST</a></li>
<li>If you are doing Se, then you are doing code. If you are converting &#8216;classic&#8217; manual testers to do automation you need to start thinking about <a href="http://deancornish.blogspot.com/2010/07/training-testers-in-how-to-code.html">Training Testers in how to code&#8230;</a></li>
<li>While not directly related to Se, <a href="http://blog.nobien.net/2010/07/19/practicing-continuous-integration-on-flash-projects-using-hudson/">Practicing Continuous Integration on Flash Projects: Using Hudson</a> is the wrapup post in a series on doing what it says. If you are doing CI, and of course <i>everyone</i> is, then it needs to be for all parts of your system</li>

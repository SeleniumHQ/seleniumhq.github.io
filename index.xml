Overview Over time, projects tend to accumulate large numbers of tests. As the total number of tests increases, it becomes harder to make changes to the codebase &amp;mdash; a single &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; change may cause numerous tests to fail, even though the application still works properly. Sometimes these problems are unavoidable, but when they do occur you want to be up and running again as quickly as possible. The following design patterns and strategies have been used before with WebDriver to help make tests easier to write and maintain.</description></item><item><title>Waiting with Expected Conditions</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/support_features/expected_conditions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/support_features/expected_conditions/</guid><description>Expected Conditions are used with Explicit Waits. Instead of defining the block of code to be executed with a lambda, an expected conditions method can be created to represent common things that get waited on.

Odds are that, at some point, if you are working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.
Functional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It is a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.</description></item><item><title>Script</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/webdriver_bidi/script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/webdriver_bidi/script/</guid><description>Commands This section contains the APIs related to script commands.

WebDriver is a large project: if we tried to push everything into a single monolithic build file it eventually becomes unmanageable. We know this. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried it. So we broke the single Rakefile into a series of build.desc files. Each of these describe a part of the build.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a build.desc file.

Selenium allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.</description></item><item><title>File downloads</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/discouraged/file_downloads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/discouraged/file_downloads/</guid><description>Whilst it is possible to start a download by clicking a link with a browser under Selenium&amp;rsquo;s control, the API does not expose download progress, making it less than ideal for testing downloaded files. This is because downloading files is not considered an important aspect of emulating user interaction with the web platform. Instead, find the link using Selenium (and any required cookies) and pass it to a HTTP request library like libcurl.</description></item><item><title>Finding web elements</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/</guid><description>One of the most fundamental aspects of using Selenium is obtaining element references to work with.

It is worth to highlight that Selenium 1 is not supported anymore.
How Selenium RC Works First, we will describe how the components of Selenium RC operate and the role each plays in running your test scripts.
RC Components Selenium RC components are:
The Selenium Server which launches and kills browsers, interprets and runs the Selenese commands passed from the test program, and acts as an HTTP proxy, intercepting and verifying HTTP messages passed between the browser and the AUT.</description></item><item><title>Types of Testing</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/testing_types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/testing_types/</guid><description>Acceptance testing This type of testing is done to determine if a feature or system meets the customer expectations and requirements. This type of testing generally involves the customer&amp;rsquo;s cooperation or feedback, being a validation activity that answers the question:

Users who are new to the framework can begin by using the new WebDriver APIs for writing their tests. But what of users who already have suites of existing tests? This guide is designed to demonstrate how to migrate your existing tests to the new APIs, allowing all new tests to be written using the new features offered by WebDriver.</description></item><item><title>Working With Colors</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/support_features/colors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/support_features/colors/</guid><description>You will occasionally want to validate the colour of something as part of your tests; the problem is that colour definitions on the web are not constant.

Backing Selenium with WebDriver The Java and .NET versions of WebDriver provide implementations of the existing Selenium API. In Java, it is used like so:
// You may use any WebDriver implementation. Firefox is used here as an example WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // A &amp;#34;base url&amp;#34;, used by selenium to resolve relative URLs String baseUrl = &amp;#34;http://www.google.com&amp;#34;; // Create the Selenium implementation Selenium selenium = new WebDriverBackedSelenium(driver, baseUrl); // Perform actions with selenium selenium.</description></item><item><title>Grid endpoints</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/advanced_features/endpoints/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/advanced_features/endpoints/</guid><description>Grid Grid Status Grid status provides the current state of the Grid. It consists of details about every registered Node. For every Node, the status includes information regarding Node availability, sessions, and slots.
cURL GET &amp;#39;http://localhost:4444/status&amp;#39; Delete session Deleting the session terminates the WebDriver session, quits the driver and removes it from the active sessions map.

This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.
Selenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user.</description></item><item><title>Page object models</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/</guid><description>Note: this page has merged contents from multiple sources, including the Selenium wiki
Overview Within your web app&amp;rsquo;s UI, there are areas where your tests interact with. A Page Object only models these as objects within the test code. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes, the fix needs only to be applied in one place.

Selenium uses the native support implemented by each browser to carry out the automation process. For this reason, Selenium users need to place a component called driver (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) between the script using the Selenium API and the browser. For many years, managing these drivers was a manual process for Selenium users.</description></item><item><title>Driver Service Class</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/drivers/service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/drivers/service/</guid><description>The Service classes are for managing the starting and stopping of local drivers. They cannot be used with a Remote WebDriver session.
Service classes allow you to specify information about the driver, like location and which port to use. They also let you specify what arguments get passed to the command line. Most of the useful arguments are related to logging.

Introduction WebDriver has a comprehensive suite of tests that describe the expected behavior of a new implementation. We&amp;rsquo;ll assume that you&amp;rsquo;re implementing the driver in Java for the sake of simplicity, but you can take a look at any of the existing implementations for how we handle more complex builds or other languages once you&amp;rsquo;ve read this.

The processes often end up in a race condition where sometimes the browser gets into the right state first (things work as intended) and sometimes the Selenium code executes first (things do not work as intended). This is one of the primary causes of flaky tests.</description></item><item><title>Scroll wheel actions</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/actions_api/wheel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/actions_api/wheel/</guid><description>Selenium v4.2

There are 5 scenarios for scrolling on a page.
Scroll to element This is the most common scenario. Unlike traditional click and send keys methods, the actions class does not automatically scroll the target element into view, so this method will need to be used if elements are not already inside the viewport.
This method takes a web element as the sole argument.
Regardless of whether the element is above or below the current viewscreen, the viewport will be scrolled so the bottom of the element is at the bottom of the screen.</description></item><item><title>Improved reporting</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/improved_reporting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/improved_reporting/</guid><description>Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit test frameworks is a good start.

Not because it cannot be done, but because WebDriver is definitely not the most ideal tool for this. WebDriver needs time to start up, and can take several seconds, up to a minute depending on how your test is written, just to get to the page and traverse through the DOM.
Instead of using WebDriver for this, you could save a ton of time by executing a curl command, or using a library such as BeautifulSoup since these methods do not rely on creating a browser and navigating to a page.</description></item><item><title>Avoid sharing state</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/avoid_sharing_state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/avoid_sharing_state/</guid><description>Although mentioned in several places, it is worth mentioning again.

In general, if HTML IDs are available, unique, and consistently predictable, they are the preferred method for locating an element on a page. They tend to work very quickly, and forego much processing that comes with complicated DOM traversals.
If unique IDs are unavailable, a well-written CSS selector is the preferred method of locating an element. XPath works as well as CSS selectors, but the syntax is complicated and frequently difficult to debug.</description></item><item><title>Google Summer of Code 2011</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/legacy/developers/summer_of_code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/legacy/developers/summer_of_code/</guid><description>This documentation previously located on the wiki

All implementations of WebDriver that communicate with the browser, or a RemoteWebDriver server shall use a common wire protocol. This wire protocol defines a RESTful web service using JSON over HTTP.
The protocol will assume that the WebDriver API has been &amp;ldquo;flattened&amp;rdquo;, but there is an expectation that client implementations will take a more Object-Oriented approach, as demonstrated in the existing Java API.

Q: What is WebDriver? A: WebDriver is a tool for writing automated tests of websites. It aims to mimic the behaviour of a real user, and as such interacts with the HTML of the application.
Q: So, is it like Selenium? Or Sahi? A: The aim is the same (to allow you to test your webapp), but the implementation is different. Rather than running as a Javascript application within the browser (with the limitations this brings, such as the &amp;ldquo;same origin&amp;rdquo; problem), WebDriver controls the browser itself.</description></item><item><title>Musings about how things came to be</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/about/history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/about/history/</guid><description>This documentation previously located on the wiki

Unfortunately, this can lead to muddying the waters of which features are available in any of the products out there especially when we compare apples to apples.
Selenium has always been a great tool for browser automation. Fortunately for the project, it has become the tool of choice for testing web applications for nearly 2 decades.</description></item><item><title>Removal of AbstractEventListener + EventFiringWebDriver + WebDriverEventListener</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-removal-of-deprecated-events-classes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-removal-of-deprecated-events-classes/</guid><description>Upgrading to WebDriverListener and EventFiringDecorator Decorating the webdriver

Selenium Manager is a binary tool (implemented in Rust) that provides automated driver management for Selenium. Selenium Manager is still in beta, although it is becoming a relevant component of Selenium.
So far, the main feature of Selenium Manager is called automated driver management. I use the term management for this feature (and not just download) since this process is broader and implies different steps:</description></item><item><title>Building Selenium</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/</guid><description>One of the things that we knew from the very beginning of the Selenium project was that people like to code in more than one language. Some people love a bit of JS, others Ruby, and still others prefer C# or Java.
To complicate matters, there’s plenty of pieces we want to share between the language bindings you’ll be using. Examples include the “atoms” (re-usable pieces of javascript that perform common functions – such as “isDisplayed” or “getAttribute” – that we want to work the same way no matter which language you prefer to write tests in), things like our CDP support, which uses shared files that describe all the available functions we can call, and the new Selenium Manager, which is written in Rust, but we bundle with each of the language bindings.</description></item><item><title>Java 8 support in Selenium</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</guid><description>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a saying you may have heard, but sometimes it’s necessary to move on from our old favorites. That’s why we’re announcing that Selenium will stop supporting Java 8 on September 30, 2023. This applies for both the Java bindings and the Selenium Grid.
Selenium has long supported Java 8, but as technology evolves, so must we. One of the primary reasons for this change is that Java 8 reached the end of active support over a year ago.</description></item><item><title>TLC Meeting - June 8, 2023</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2023/tlc-06-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2023/tlc-06-08/</guid><description>Meetings are happening on the #selenium-tlc channel on Selenium Slack.

It allows users to run automated scripts in headless mode, meaning that the browser window wouldn’t be visible. In most of Selenium&amp;rsquo;s bindings there is a convenience method to set this execution mode while setting the browser options. However, Selenium 4.8.0 will be deprecated this method and now users need to set it through arguments when setting the browser options.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4.8.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-8-0-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-8-0-released/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.8.0 for Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, and Javascript as well as the Grid and Internet Explorer Driver.

It could be said that when working with Selenium, a critical aspect of writing tests is &amp;ldquo;locators, locators, locators!&amp;rdquo;. Having a robust locator strategy - in your app under test and in your test framework - is highly important for effective testing.
If you are a Pythonista like myself and using Selenium for your test automation, then there are some important changes coming to how locators are defined and used.</description></item><item><title>TLC Meeting - January 19, 2022</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2022/tlc-01-19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2022/tlc-01-19/</guid><description>Meetings are happening on the #selenium-tlc channel on Selenium Slack.
Agenda Minor and patch versions. Ideally we want to include new features and bug fixes on minor versions, and use patch versions only for bug fixes. A scenario where feature parity is achieved across bindings for every minor release is desired. OperaDriver is not supporting W3C. We should probably delete all Opera classes from the bindings, given that Opera can be driven via the appropriately versioned ChromeDriver by specifying the location of the Opera browser.</description></item><item><title>IE Mode in Edge supported by IEDriver</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/ie-edge-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/ie-edge-support/</guid><description>With the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) later this year, the folks in Redmond have helped the Selenium project with getting IE Mode in Microsoft Edge working in IEDriver.
IE 11 is due to retire on 15 June 2022 for certain versions of Windows 10. After this date, the Selenium project recommends that you test your IE sites with IE Mode in Microsoft Edge. The Selenium Project will not remove support for IE 11 when it retires but we will not actively fix issues as we have done with previous versions of IE.</description></item><item><title>TLC Meeting - December 08, 2021</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2021/tlc-12-08/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2021/tlc-12-08/</guid><description>Meetings are held on the #selenium-tlc channel on Selenium Slack.

This, in an effort to offer a more inclusive environment for Selenium users who do not have English as their mother tongue.
This effort grew organically, and we got many pull requests adding content for different languages. Over time, some translations got to a very good state, and others didn&amp;rsquo;t get much attention. This brought the situation where 9 different languages are available in the documentation, but only a few add value to the readers.</description></item><item><title>TLC Meeting - November 24, 2021</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2021/tlc-11-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/meetings/2021/tlc-11-24/</guid><description>Meetings are held on the #selenium-tlc channel on Selenium Slack.

This is available for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and Javascript. You can download it from your favourite package manager or right from GitHub!
If you’re already a Selenium user, this update should be as easy as just changing your dependency from 3.x to 4.0.0. We’ve worked hard to ensure that this is a “drop-in” upgrade, having focused on keeping the public APIs as stable as possible.</description></item><item><title>A Tour of 4: Authentication</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/a-tour-of-4-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/a-tour-of-4-authentication/</guid><description>Before we ship Selenium 4, I thought it would be nice to introduce some of the new features in-depth.

The first thing I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to is Selenium 4&amp;rsquo;s new-found ability to authenticate to websites. We&amp;rsquo;ve always been able to handle &amp;ldquo;form-based&amp;rdquo; authentication, where a login page has some INPUT elements that you need to enter the user name and password, but handling sites that use basic or digest authentication has always been harder.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4 Release Candidate 2</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve listeneed and responded to the feedback from the first release candidate of Selenium 4, and we&amp;rsquo;re now happy to announce the second release candidate of Selenium 4.

With Selenium 4, we have integrated OpenTelemetry to help you troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and provide visibility into the system. By making the Selenium server observable, we are putting more power into your hands.
Need for Observability Selenium server enables distributed testing. Instead of running the browsers for tests locally, the tests use a remote browser driver that points to a server.</description></item><item><title>Public Project Meeting - April 22, 2021</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/public-project-meeting-20210422/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/public-project-meeting-20210422/</guid><description>Archived meeting minutes All meeting minutes can now be found here. &amp;times; Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings, here is the timeline of the meeting held on April 22, 2021,5:30 PM CET.

We’ve covered a lot of ground in the past few blog posts, including how to contribute to the project, and some details of what you can expect as a Selenium user. But there’s more to Selenium than just the APIs you use to write your tests, and one of the big features we’ve not covered yet is the refreshed Selenium Grid: a mechanism that allows you to distribute your tests across a fleet of machines.</description></item><item><title>Public Project Meeting - January 28, 2021</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/public-project-meeting-20210128/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/public-project-meeting-20210128/</guid><description>Archived meeting minutes All meeting minutes can now be found here. &amp;times; Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings, here is the timeline of the meeting held on January 28, 2021,5:30 PM CET.(Below times are on IST)

Batteries included Browser Management Unsurprisingly, people find having to manage browsers a task they wish they didn’t have to do and wish that Selenium did this. 59.5% of respondents want Selenium to manage the browsers for them. This, though the question didn’t ask this, is to include the browser drivers.

However, when the project was moved to GitHub, the repository followed the traditional use of master as a name for the default git branch.
With the intention of making the Selenium project an even more inclusive place where everyone is welcome, a decision was made to use trunk as the default git branch and, after the switch, delete the master branch.</description></item><item><title>Public Project Meeting - August 13, 2020</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/public-project-meeting-20200813/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/public-project-meeting-20200813/</guid><description>Archived meeting minutes All meeting minutes can now be found here. &amp;times; Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings, here is the timeline of the meeting held on August 13, 2020 (times are on IST).

This was a very natural fit when we were using SVN over a decade ago on Google Code.
As Google Code shut down we moved to GitHub and the git model of doing things. We moved there mostly due to the gravity that GitHub had created in Open Source projects.
This meant that we followed the standard use of master as our trunk to work off.</description></item><item><title>How Selenium Works: Episode 1 - Transportation</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-transport/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-transport/</guid><description>After an interaction on the last weekend of January 2020, on a Selenium Issue where someone said “why can’t you just…” after I explained the issue I thought that I would start explaining commands in Selenium WebDriver and why we landed on the design that we have today.

Selenium IDE (or as we’ll refer to it from here on out – the Legacy IDE) was, and is, dead.
Since then quite a lot has happened with the IDE. We have a new version of it which we are referring to as… Selenium IDE!
It is currently in “alpha” and available for use in both Chrome and Firefox.</description></item><item><title>Firefox 55 and Selenium IDE</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</guid><description>The bad news: from Firefox 55 onwards, Selenium IDE will no longer work.
The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:
Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox faster and more stable, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “XPI” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “Web Extension” mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Hacking with IntelliJ</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</guid><description>Jetbrains have a programme for Open Source projects which allows them to receive IntelliJ IDEA licenses. As part of that programme, which the Selenium project has participated in for many years, they’ve asked us to provide a fair and balanced review of IntelliJ. I’ll attempt to do that, and I’ll try and state my biases up-front so you’re aware of them.
I’ve been using Jetbrain’s IntelliJ to hack on the Selenium code since I started working on it slightly over ten years ago.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3.0: Out Now!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</guid><description>We are very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 3.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:
As we’ve said before, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3 is Coming</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</guid><description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that “beta 4” will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR: WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update.

I’m looking forward to seeing you there!
One of the plans we’ve had from the very beginning for SeConf was that it was going to be a conference for the community of people who make Selenium such a fun project to work on. One way to do this was to host the conference where the largest groups of people using Selenium are found.</description></item><item><title>Selenium Hangout 4 Recap</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2014/selenium-hangout-4-recap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2014/selenium-hangout-4-recap/</guid><description>Here’s a recap from the latest Selenium Hangout panel discussion.

Projects such as Appium, iosdriver, and Selendroid have all shown that this approach works, and works well.

It’s now two years old, and what a couple of years it’s been! The WebDriver APIs, which were the major addition in Selenium 2, are now the basis for a W3C standard, and there are implementations written and supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera. There have been 34 releases, with official support for Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript, and the community has stepped in to provide bindings for Perl, PHP and others.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #157</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-157/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-157/</guid><description>Trying to find every excuse not to cut the grass … including apparently closing some browser tabs.

A brand new IE driver.</description></item><item><title>Atoms have come to Selenium IDE</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/atoms-have-come-to-selenium-ide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/atoms-have-come-to-selenium-ide/</guid><description>As mentioned in Simon’s Going Atomic: Why? and Going Atomic: How, part of the merging of Selenium and WebDriver is to share common code between the two. And as of the 1.0.10 release of Selenium IDE, this merged code, ‘atoms’ is now included.
Some early users of this release are noticing that this the atom that drives assertAttribute and verifyAttribute is causing their scripts to break.

Still here? Excellent.
Let’s take a step back to just before the Selenium and WebDriver projects merged. There were, very obviously, two separate codebases. Looking closer and with a slightly different perspective, there were more than this. We used the test suites for webdriver to define the behaviour for multiple, largely independent, driver codebases.</description></item><item><title>Selenium at Agile 2010</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-at-agile-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-at-agile-2010/</guid><description>The Selenium project does not have an ‘official’ presence here at Agile as it is seen as a ‘test after’ tool rather than ‘test first’ — even though it provides the magic of the ‘test first’ frameworks… But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.

I’m Raynatou, I come from Burkina and do my internship at SERLI. Like all interns in this company the topic of my internship focuses on advanced topics like the integration of WebDriver as backend for Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE is currently built upon Selenium Core for interacting with web pages. Selenium Core has several major limitations, including the inability to fire native events. To avoid these limitations and produce more robust tests, I am investigating Selenium IDE to using WebDriver in place of Selenium Core.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #22</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</guid><description>Happy Simcoe Day.

In this post, I hope to address the most immediate questions about what this means for the future of Selenium Grid.

You can download it now (http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip).
There is no functional difference between this version and 1.0.2, other than it is packaged up a little nicer and we’ve clarified the relationship between selenium-server and the client drivers. That is: we are not releasing new client drivers with future 1.x releases. The reason is that we locked down the API in version 1.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 1.0.2 Released: Firefox 3.6 and Snow Leopard Support</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</guid><description>Today we’re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released.

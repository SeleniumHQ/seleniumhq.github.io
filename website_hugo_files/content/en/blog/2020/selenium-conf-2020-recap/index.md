This year the [Selenium Conference](https://2020.seleniumconf.in/) was held virtually, and 
despite that, the conference was again that exciting place where the Selenium community 
meets every year to share and learn about the most popular browser automation tool in the 
world. The conference offered talks about improved testing practices, new tools to simplify 
the setup of automated tests, the future of Selenium, and lots of learnings from speakers 
who shared their use cases and practical advice for how they use Selenium at work.

Here are some takeaways and interesting talks from this year’s conference:

## Selenium: State of the Union

A peek at the upcoming Selenium 4 release was possible thanks to the demo 
[Simon Stewart](https://twitter.com/shs96c) gave during this traditional 
[talk](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14020/selenium-state-of-the-union) 
that happens in every Selenium conference. Selenium 4 is shaping up nicely and will leave 
the Alpha state soon. We are all looking forward to the betas, and a candidate release 
shortly after that. The talk also invited other members of the Selenium team to share the 
organizational work they have been doing in the project, including diversity, governance 
and welcoming contributors.

## Build a responsive typescript wdio framework

[Varuna Srivastava](https://twitter.com/vibranttester) gave a 
[talk](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13629/build-a-responsive-typescript-wdio-framework) 
together with [Wim Selles](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13629/build-a-responsive-typescript-wdio-framework) 
that showed how to build a robust and scalable framework for UI testing, based on WebdriverIO. 
It showed concepts that are important when getting started with JavaScript, NodeJS, and the NPM 
ecosystem. Furthermore, there was a broad overview of WebdriverIO and its shiny features, as well 
as a demo on how to use TypeScript for testing. This is a recommended talk for anyone who wants to 
get started on testing with JavaScript.

## To Test and monitor one website is not that hard, but what if you need to do it to over 40 websites?

This was an interesting [talk](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/schedule) from 
[Jesus Sanchez](https://twitter.com/qa_jesus), where in order to avoid having the QA department as 
a bottleneck for the growing team of developers, they took the approach of building tools and resources 
for developers and enabling them to write tests for their over 40 websites. It is an interesting take 
on how the QA role becomes a facilitator and an enabler for the rest of the organization, while 
coaching everyone on how to write automated tests and the value of testing the right thing.

## Careers in Testing – Identify your SuperPower

[Smita Mishra](https://twitter.com/smitapmishra) gave a 
[captivating](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13771/careers-in-testing-identify-your-superpower) 
talk where she invited all testers to think what alternative paths could be present in their careers, 
given that some organizations value testing more than others. Smita showed that if you understand what 
you enjoy the most, and find a way to combine that with your current and future skills, it could show 
you how to grow your career by finding and following a path of the least resistance.

## Developing Selenium tests with JUnit 5

JUnit 5 is the new iteration of this popular testing framework, and it implements a new programming 
and extension model named Jupiter. [Boni García](https://twitter.com/boni_gg) presents in this 
[talk](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13255/developing-selenium-tests-with-junit-5) 
a JUnit 5 extension called [Selenium-Jupiter](https://bonigarcia.github.io/selenium-jupiter/), 
the demos showed illustrate how useful this extension is because it simplifies the test configuration 
and reduces the boilerplate code that needs to be written in order to have a test running. Have a 
look at it because it is well maintained and documented, and it will help you by reducing the time 
needed to set up your tests.

## I'm Not Special

One of the [keynotes](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14005/im-not-special) in 
the conference was done by [Jim Evans](https://twitter.com/jimevansmusic), where he relates a 
personal journey through his career and how clearly “not special” he considers himself. One of 
the key takeaways is the fact that you become a major contributor and you do not need to be special 
to do that. No review will make enough justice to highlight how heartwarming and encouraging this 
talk was, it is a must watch for anyone who wants to become a contributor.

## Closing keynote

The final session of the conference was the 
[keynote](https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14836/q-a-with-the-selenium-committee) 
where the project committers do an open Q&A with the community. Different opinions were shared around 
the question of the challenges the Selenium project sees by the growing number of browser automation 
tools. In addition, all project contributors made an open invitation to the community to get involved 
in the project, if you are interested in that, please check the project’s 
[governance document](https://www.selenium.dev/governance/). This is another recommended session 
to watch, lots of insights about how the project and its individuals work that will help the community 
understand the project better.

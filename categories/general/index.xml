      <title>Selenium IDE Is Dead, Long Live Selenium IDE! </title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2018/long-live-selenium-ide/</link>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2018/long-live-selenium-ide/</guid>
      <description>In August of 2017 Simon shared the bleak, hard news that as of Firefox 55 Selenium IDE would no longer work. Selenium IDE (or as we’ll refer to it from here on out – the Legacy IDE) was, and is, dead.
Since then quite a lot has happened with the IDE. We have a new version of it which we are referring to as… Selenium IDE!
It is currently in “alpha” and available for use in both Chrome and Firefox.</description>

      <title>Firefox 55 and Selenium IDE</title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</link>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</guid>
      <description>The bad news: from Firefox 55 onwards, Selenium IDE will no longer work. 
The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:
 Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox faster and more stable, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “XPI” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “Web Extension” mechanism.</description>

      <description>Jetbrains have a programme for Open Source projects which allows them to receive IntelliJ IDEA licenses. As part of that programme, which the Selenium project has participated in for many years, they&amp;#8217;ve asked us to provide a fair and balanced review of IntelliJ. I&amp;#8217;ll attempt to do that, and I&amp;#8217;ll try and state my biases up-front so you&amp;#8217;re aware of them.
I&amp;#8217;ve been using Jetbrain&amp;#8217;s IntelliJ to hack on the Selenium code since I started working on it slightly over ten years ago.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</guid>
      <description>We are very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 3.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:
As we’ve said before, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability.</description>

      <description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that &amp;#8220;beta 4&amp;#8221; will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR:  WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description>

      <description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released &amp;#8220;by Christmas&amp;#8221;. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We&amp;#8217;re excited to announce the release of the first beta &amp;#8212; Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.
We&amp;#8217;d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re excited to announce that we&amp;#8217;ve finally determined where and when Selenium Conf will be happening this Fall.
Our initial goal was to bring the event to a new country, but for a number of reasons that proved more challenging than we&amp;#8217;d hoped. But in 2012 we had the 2nd annual Selenium Conf in London, and we&amp;#8217;re pleased to be bringing it back there this year!
The conference will be held at The Mermaid in downtown London on November 14-16:</description>

      <description>Every year, Jetbrains are kind enough to donate an OSS license for IntelliJ to the Selenium project. As part of that process, they&amp;#8217;ve asked that we review the product and (kudos to them!) have been clear that they hope we&amp;#8217;re open and honest. So, I&amp;#8217;ll be open and honest.
When I tell people that I&amp;#8217;m a professional Java developer, people in some circles make sympathetic noises and (sometimes) jokingly refer to how painful my coding life must be.</description>

      <description>It makes me enormously happy and proud to announce that the Selenium Conference 2014 will be held in Bangalore on the 4-6 September. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing you there!
One of the plans we&amp;#8217;ve had from the very beginning for SeConf was that it was going to be a conference for the community of people who make Selenium such a fun project to work on. One way to do this was to host the conference where the largest groups of people using Selenium are found.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: We&amp;#8217;re retiring Selenium&amp;#8217;s own AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver in favour of any of Selendroid, iosdriver and Appium. If you&amp;#8217;re using one of Selenium&amp;#8217;s own mobile drivers, please evaluate one of these alternatives.
The longer version:
In 2007, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone and changed the mobile Web from a curiosity to something the mainstream wanted and used. Current trends suggest that mobile Web usage will surpass desktop usage in the not too distant future.</description>

      <description>Although the WebDriver APIs started life as just a mechanism for automating web browsers, over the past few years it has been extended to also work on mobile devices. Projects such as Appium, iosdriver, and Selendroid have all shown that this approach works, and works well. On the Web, if you start using Selenium WebDriver with one browser (Firefox, for example), it&amp;#8217;s easy to switch out the browser for another one (such as Internet Explorer or Chrome).</description>

      <description>Selenium 2 was released in July 2011. It’s now two years old, and what a couple of years it’s been! The WebDriver APIs, which were the major addition in Selenium 2, are now the basis for a W3C standard, and there are implementations written and supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera. There have been 34 releases, with official support for Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript, and the community has stepped in to provide bindings for Perl, PHP and others.</description>

      <description>Trying to find every excuse not to cut the grass &amp;#8230; including apparently closing some browser tabs.
 Interoperability – Standardized Test Information Interchange has me so full of &amp;#8216;meh&amp;#8217; as to be hilarious. Commercially driven standards rarely are and/or I am just too much of an open source person to accept this model for standards development Licensing in a Post Copyright World &amp;#8211; important How to Make Async Requests in PHP is php specific in its solution, but has some interesting bits about socket establishment that applies to other ones as well Adding Comments to JSON feels like a hack.</description>

      <description>Brain fried from PyCon Canada 2013 and &amp;#8216;some&amp;#8217; browser tab is misbehaving which means its time to start closing some of these.

Selenium Meetups are great, but&amp;#8230;
Have you ever wanted to attend a Selenium Meetup but there&amp;#8217;s not one near you? Or maybe there is but something&amp;#8217;s come up and you can&amp;#8217;t make it out that night? Or maybe the meetup near you struggles to get good speakers and have a consistent schedule?</description>

Selenium/Webdriver has kept my family fed since 2007. Since I&amp;#8217;ve never committed a line of code to this magical project, I thought the least I could do was spend a few hours helping put SeConf 2013 together. When they asked for a volunteer to put the speaker program together, I was thrilled to step forward!</description>

      <description>Whoops, missed a couple days&amp;#8230; ah well.
 MOAR ELEMENTS!!! the &amp;lt;main&amp;gt; element Dependency injection != Inversion of Control is useful reading. And the Waffle example is pretty funny. Not sure yet how I feel about this feature in the page-object gem.
 Waiting for an application to be fully loaded has some more examples of using a &amp;#8216;proper&amp;#8217; [not implicit] waiting strategy. Most of us are not using Se for HVAT, but knowing the terminology, etc.</description>

      <description>This short technical note is to announce that the Selenium project is now using git on Google Code in place of subversion.
The move has been a long time in the making, and it&amp;#8217;s largely thanks to the efforts of Kristian Rosenvold that we&amp;#8217;ve been able to do the migration and retain the project history. The project owes him a huge thank you! We&amp;#8217;re in the process of migrating the last bits and pieces (none of which are user facing), so there may be some last minute turbulence as we settle everything down.</description>

      <description>Someone go back to my past self and punch him for thinking that starting to get in shape was a good idea. OMGCANTMOVE.
 .NET Goes Immutable seems interesting. But I don&amp;#8217;t really speak C# so it could very well be boring and uninteresting. Shadow DOM 101 is another part of HTML5 that makes me think this web automation stuff has a very limited life span. Between this and Canvas&amp;#8230; ugh.</description>

      <description>Hrm. Office is closed until Monday, but everyone is in. Very confusing&amp;#8230;
 One reason I have heard people say they don&amp;#8217;t use cloud instances is they are afraid they will just sit around idle when not needed. Behind the clouds: how RelEng do Firefox builds on AWS has some useful scripts to find and teardown machines. Page Weight Matters is a fun little insight into how/why YouTube shed some of its heft.</description>

      <description>Not sure how widely broadcast this has been (cus, you know, we&amp;#8217;re good at communicating and stuff), but if you are using 2.26.0 and Firefox 17 you will get a nasty bug. 2.27.0 is in the works to address this (and a couple other things&amp;#8230;) so if you need FF right now, keep your install at the latest 16 release.
 This is pretty decent. Except the usual &amp;#8220;Feh! We don&amp;#8217;t need humans to test!</description>

      <description>Can&amp;#8217;t get enough Se bloggage? Have a look at Overview of Selenium Blogs &amp;#8212; though I must say there has to be something wrong with the Alexa algorithm if I am that far down the list. And behind both David and Alister. 🙂
Must Have Git Aliases: Advanced Examples reminds me of someone I used to work with who likely couldn&amp;#8217;t function on a clean unix system, but with all his aliases was mind blowing to watch Writing a Selenium Test Framework for a Django Site (Part 3) has the usual myths and FUD around XPath and embeds locators in the script method but is the first thing I&amp;#8217;ve seen that uses the Color class in Python so I&amp;#8217;ll overlook those things.</description>

      <description>A hardy welcome back to work to our American friends who spent Thursday being thankful for what they had, then getting into fist fights at stores for things they thought they didn&amp;#8217;t need the next day.
 You know what would be grand? If various widget makers would provide automation hooks for their stuff so we, as automators, don&amp;#8217;t have to write them ourselves. Like for High Charts (in Java) Why you should never use a boolean field (use an Enum instead) is food for thought when designing your page objects Do you work for Google?</description>

      <description>&amp;#8230;as I avoid writing code that deals with dynamically constructed tables. Without any sort of unique locator. Of course.
 I would contend that the &amp;#8216;right&amp;#8217; solution to this problem is to use a CI container and have it email you, but if you are using Java and not using CI, then Automatically Email the Reports After Selenium Test Execution could be valuable. I feel like I have already linked to Webdriver StaleElementReferenceException but the archive search is, erm, not great, so here it is again.</description>

      <description>Within an hour I had some more things to add to the last Smattering. Oh well, I&amp;#8217;ll just save them up&amp;#8230;
 Har-assert looks like something useful to include in your project if you are using Java. And the browsermob-proxy (which of course, you all are) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 seems like something more people should care about. Right.

Of course, now the trick is to keep it up to date. 🙂 Screening uses Se deep in its guts to script up Montage apps Millions of web pages use the -moz-opacity:0.</description>

 Thucydides has a spiffy new website How Eventbrite uses Jenkins and Selenium which I think I&amp;#8217;ve linked to before, but can&amp;#8217;t seem to find reference to.

 The dangers of uniformity pours cold water on something that I know I used to preach for automation environments. How to crawl a quarter billion webpages in 40 hours doesn&amp;#8217;t have code listed (he explains why) but it explains how you could write it yourself if you wanted.</description>

Ah well, until that battle resolves itself, here are some links.
Firefox the Clear Winner for Automated Testing has a wonderfully SEO friendly title, but really is just some cool usage graphs for their system. Extrapolate beyond that at your own risk. Task Automation FTW! &amp;#8212; make your application installable! I did something like this a decade ago (also using python) but finding something in my own blog seems a harder challenge than it should be.</description>

 The Automation Litmus Test is one that most companies face, but now it has a name Okay, who has more info on the bots mentioned in Meet the &amp;#8216;bots&amp;#8217; that edit Wikipedia? Highly doubt that they are Se powered, but it is a fun mental image Custom PHPUnit Annotations is useful magic if you are building out a framework I&amp;#8217;ve linked to things before about where to put things and how to find them, and purpose-oriented tests continues that trend Moving Towards a Continuous Integration and Deployment Process is a nice explanation of how one team does Continuous Delivery.</description>

 Marionette &amp;#8211; The Future of FirefoxDriver in Selenium is a project that has been hinted at here before I think, but this is its coming out party. Oh.

 As Se marches towards being a W3C standard, the sort of thing in OAuth and API Providers: Come on guys. scares me more and more. Why WP_Error Sucks. Intelligent error handling is hard. Especially when you have a legacy install base to deal with. A nice little rant.

 Butter Performance is a nice experience report on making a [big] html table behave. All sorts of headaches this would cause for automation. I&amp;#8217;m now starting to think more about caching since some of that information is included in HAR files. So if you are automating against a Rails site, Advanced Caching in Rails: Revised could be of values Scaling lessons learned at Dropbox, part 1 is another fun experience report including a bit of hints at Dropbox&amp;#8217;s own version of Netflix&amp;#8217;s Chaos Monkey Finding the broken links in a webpage using Selenium is Se-RC, but the idea is sound.</description>

 Testing JSF with Arquillian and Selenium apparently will save the world. GhostDriver: almost 50% is an update on something that got a bit of momentum at SeConf2012 Building and profiling high performance systems with Iago is getting a bump by being released at/during Velocity. Not browser based, but what its being used for doesn&amp;#8217;t need browsers.

 Selenium-RC Commands is a mindmap of all the commands in Se-RC. (Unsurprising really.)

But Three ways to generate test data for your ruby automated tests Downloading things is a pain, but Waiting for watir-webdriver downloads (and determining the file name) has a solution Use classes in Python? Of course you do! Under the hood of Python class definitions &amp;#8212; but as the warning states, If the prospect of pondering the metaclass of the metaclass of your class makes you feel nauseated, you better stop now.</description>

 Python Decorators is an attempt at picking up a stick the right way A lawnchair is sorta like a couch except smaller and outside. And a persistence solution for HTML5 apps.

 Automated Software Testing: An Example of a Working Solution is an interesting take on designing an automation system for the US DoD. It sure as heck isn&amp;#8217;t how I would do it, but I can understand how this context might lead to this solution. And it seems like it is Eclipse based which is even worse a decision. 🙂 5 Tips on Finding a Mobile Job in Toronto is pretty focused, but also applies to non-mobile jobs outside of Toronto.</description>

For me, one of the highlights of any conference is the chance to meet other members of the community, make new friends and talk about all things interesting (and perhaps even tangentially related to the conference!</description>

      <description>I may be biased, but I think Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12 is going to be great. There are talks aimed at every level of Selenium user. We&amp;#8217;ve gotexperience reports, so you can learn from the trials and tribulations of others. There are talks about using Selenium in unusual ways, such as performance testing, orautomated security testing, so you can see new ideas and approaches.
There are technical talks, such as the one Jim Evans is giving on lessons learned from developing the IE driver, so you can learn a little bit more about how Selenium works and Luke Daley&amp;#8217;s talk about Geb is bound to be fun.</description>

We recently selected the speakers for the conference, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I&amp;#8217;m promised that there will be robots.
Selenium Conf isn&amp;#8217;t just about the planned talks, it&amp;#8217;s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there&amp;#8217;s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now&amp;#8217;s your chance.</description>

      <description>The first code checked into the Selenium project&amp;#8217;s public repository was in November, 2004. We&amp;#8217;re now in 2012. In the intervening years there have been many browsers released. The last browser we officially stopped supporting was Firefox 2.0, and it&amp;#8217;s time to review the list of browsers again.
We periodically review the list of supported browsers as the more changes there are between the oldest version of a browser that we support and the most recent, the harder it is for us to add new features and maintain those that already exist.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re using Selenium RC to test websites hosted on a secure site (accessed using a URL starting with HTTPS), we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Selenium 2.19. This is because the Cybervillains certificate in previous versions will expire soon, and has been replaced in 2.19 with an updated one.
Our thanks to Patrick Lightbody, Ivan De Marino and Mark Watson and Neustar for taking providing the new certificate and the patch!</description>

It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcing Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12! It&amp;#8217;ll be taking place in London from the 16th to the 18th April, and we&amp;#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you all there!</description>

 For TestMate / Java folks, TextMate-Bundle-Selenium-Java could be interesting. We&amp;#8217;ve all made Oopses when writing / interpreting Se scripts, so it is important to remember that Mistakes: Transparency is Best Organizing scripts is one of those topics that gets both too much and not enough attention. Organizing Your Tests adds to the discussion &amp;#8212; though completely omits using &amp;#8216;tags&amp;#8217; (which his product supports&amp;#8230;) Not sure how this will affect automation of Android or not, but still pretty cool.</description>

      <description>In honor of this edition I provide&amp;#8230;
&amp;#8230;in which I also date myself.
 CITCon is another one of those conferences I should go to but haven&amp;#8217;t. Yet! 7 continuous integration ideas from CITCon is a quick list from the most recent iteration. Testing Facebook authentication with Rails 3 Cucumber, Capybara, Selenium has a nice little trick to get Facebook to authenticate back to your Rails stack. pennyworth is a &amp;#8216;continuous packaging system&amp;#8217; which seems like an interesting description.</description>

      <description>Its been almost a month, so time for a flurry of Smatterings.
 Maven has a bad reputation in some circles (ignoring for a second that you are using Java&amp;#8230;), but should you be using it the QuickStart Archetype looks interesting. Why Your Monitoring Is Lying To You talks about types of logging which are valuable both from a Continuous Delivery perspective and for checking the health of your application during long script runs.</description>

      <description>Spinach is a Cucumber-esque BDD framework that was advertised on twitter as having &amp;#8216;less regex magic&amp;#8217;. Not sure if it has grown Se support yet, but I have no doubt that it will soon. Coping With Big C.I. is full of stuff that is useful for even Small C.I. Sane AJAX Testing in Selenium uses &amp;#8216;reintroduced page loading&amp;#8217; for what I would call a &amp;#8216;latch&amp;#8217; but describes it better I think.</description>

      <description>Aside from one of the dog&amp;#8217;s tummy making noises that imply a big mess to clean up later, this scheduling thing seems to be working out.
 Heard someone talk about doing bitmap comparisons last week somewhere. Adaptive Images tricks I suspect are going to become more commonplace. Good luck with that. Se is best at interaction, structure and content checks; not does-it-look-the-way-some-human-intended. Robots where robots should be used. Humans where humans should be used.</description>

      <description>Trying something new; queuing up the catch-up post while I have time to catch-up.
 I&amp;#8217;ve been lead to believe that Functional Testing with Arquillian is a Big Deal&amp;amp;tm;. Of course, I just see a lot of Java&amp;#8230; If one thread raises an exception, why aren&amp;#8217;t other threads&amp;#8217; finally blocks called? is an interesting question with a nice answer.

      <description>How did I fall behind again already?!?!
 This is a pretty good deck. Automation Isn&amp;#8217;t All Shiny Toys If your work is divided in time-based goals then providing videos of the end result is a fantastic idea. See Dave&amp;#8217;s Q3/2011 in review. The last two screencasts directly relate to Se The training wheels came off is outstanding! I&amp;#8217;ve been saying this around Se-IDE for years. If you have tried automation-in-anger with Python, then you have likely spent some time swearing at the GIL.</description>

      <description>Watir to WebDriver: Unit Test Frameworks &amp;#8211; Well, its &amp;#8216;big&amp;#8217; news. Of course, Watir can use WebDriver so they didn&amp;#8217;t have to port their scripts to a different API (I sure hope they have the API well abstracted away from their scripts). And of course the title of the post implies that Facebook thinks that Watir/Selenium scripts are &amp;#8216;Unit&amp;#8217; tests which is suspect at best&amp;#8230; Selenium tests for Jenkins &amp;#8212; Yup; Jenkins now has a set of Se scripts for it.</description>

      <description>All opinions, all the time&amp;#8230;
 It all began with Test Design for Automation which lead to Automated Test Design (riffing/ripping off Alan Page) And then through some weird Jedi mind control there was Design for GUI Automation which in turn led to more UI test design (once more from Alan Page) And heck, why have two articles from the same author when you can have three?! It’s (probably) a Design Problem &amp;#8212; though I don&amp;#8217;t think Chris has riffed off this one yet&amp;#8230; Remember, Not Every Test Should be Automated!</description>

 Like the power of WebDriver, but not the API? Watir WebDriver will get you going with the Watir API. Lots of useful stuff there. So does Alister Scott&amp;#8217;s WatirMelon blog Sikuli Plays Angry Birds on Google Games &amp;#8212; just because scripts that play games are fun. cukeforker is for &amp;#8216;Forking cukes and VNC displays.&amp;#8217; First time I&amp;#8217;ve seen a group of machines referred to as a &amp;#8216;fleet&amp;#8217;, but its appropriate.</description>

      <description>Its been a month and a half since the last one of these, and the volume of links I have collected illustrates that. So this week is now a cleanup week.
 How Browsers Work: Behind the Scenes of Modern Web Browsers seems to be one of those articles that people who automate browsers for a living should be familiar with. 100% Test Coverage is always the goal. Continuous Deployment and Data Visualization reminds us that if some data is good, more is often better.</description>

      <description>And here we go again with more links than I thought I had collected&amp;#8230;
 There are a metric tonne of site on the internets which are on how to scam your way through a Se interview. Hiring Selenium QA people provides some fodder on how one could look for and hire Se folk. Why I don’t use spork reminds us that pain is [sometimes] a good thing. The Jenkins project is having a conference on October 2 in the same hotel that SeConf was held.</description>

      <description>Phew. The links made it through the Lion installation.
 Distributing the Same Test to Multiple Processes shows a technique for debugging flaky scripts Repeat after me: I will not automate GMail unless I am Google. Or if you will, you will do something like what is described in Verify email confirmation using Selenium. Notice that they are not using Se for it. Selenium and Nagios is something more teams should do I think.</description>

      <description>Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.
To this end, I have created a quick(!) survey about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.
The survey is only two questions, so I&amp;#8217;m hoping for a large response. I&amp;#8217;ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).</description>

 Ripple-UI is a cross-platform, mobile web application emulation environment. From RIM. Could be something interesting. Tips From Our Codebase To Help You Write Reliable Selenium Tests has nothing I don&amp;#8217;t violently disagree with.

      <description>Last week we released Se-IDE 1.1.0 which now features WebDriver formats and Se 2.1.0 was released about an hour ago. Simon will post something shortly-ish on what&amp;#8217;s changed.
 I haven&amp;#8217;t messed around with HTML5 goodies yes, but fake-html5 seems like it could be interesting. The Yii framework has grown WebDriver support. Now if only there were not two competing PHP implementations for them to have to choose from&amp;#8230; If you are using Python&amp;#8217;s native packaging system to share your framework, then Lies, More Lies and Python Packaging Documentation on package_data could spare you some headache This presentation kinda needs someone in front of it to make it fully understandable, but they chose great photos so I&amp;#8217;m including it.</description>

 Next week appears to be Meetup week with ones in London on Tuesday, Toronto on Wednesday and San Francisco on Thursday. It&amp;#8217;s like we coordinated or something. (But didn&amp;#8217;t.) Last month&amp;#8217;s SFSE meetup was on framework design. Here is the slides and the video.

      <description>Well, since the last Smattering there hasn&amp;#8217;t been much in the community. Oh. Well, except for hitting the 2.0.0 milestone. Which seems like a good time to remind people that:

      <description>Welcome to the Canada Day edition of the less-than-weekly-now collection of Selenium / Automation links that is the Smattering of Selenium.
 Selenium Advanced User Interactions illustrates how this new API (which is part of WebDriver) can use used to do things like drag-and-drop on Canvas elements. Things you (probably) didn’t know about xargs is one of those things to keep tucked away in your toolbox. Especially if you find yourself having to shell out in your scripts.</description>

So of course by now everyone has seen Selenium 2.0b3: The Next Gen Browser Release and upgraded their rigs. Expect Selenium IDE at some point in the next week with support for FF4 &amp;#8212; if you just. can&amp;#8217;t. wait. then you could try the bleeding edge for yourself. Logging any bugs you find; of course.

I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of using 3rd party abstraction layers (1st party are full win though) but Capybara has a large marketshare so Capybara (and Selenium) with RSpec &amp;amp; Rails 3: quick tutorial is likely going to be of interest to people. And while on the subject of Capybara, here is a post on Checking Invisible Elements in it.</description>

      <description>The big thing in the new last week was ColdFusion. Yes, ColdFusion. I was amazed how much mention it got on Twitter.  Introducing CFSelenium &amp;#8211; A Native ColdFusion Client Library for Selenium-RC Export Selenium-IDE Scripts in CFSelenium (ColdFusion) Format GitHub repo CFSelenium and VirtualBox   SeleniumCamp happened over the weekend and from the looks of things was a success. And had almost an even number of women as men &amp;#8212; which is almost unheard of at these sorts of things.</description>

 Selenium 2 &amp;#8211; Get Number of Rows in a Table illustrates what is advertised, though it feels like there has to be a shorter way to do this along the lines of getXpathCount() or getCssCount() Atlassian Plugin SDK &amp;#8211; how to provide optional selenium tests explains how to wire up Se with the Atlassian toolkit and has a couple task specific tips as well.</description>

      <description>There isn&amp;#8217;t an official announcement anywhere (yet) but Selenium 2.0b2 was released a couple hours ago. Time to upgrade all your servers. Beta 3 is going to focus on IE9 and FF4 support.
Meanwhile&amp;#8230;
  A Webinar on Automated Selenium Testing with Maestro 3 could be interesting if you are considering the Maestro platform. And sticking with the webinar idea, Sauce Labs is hosting Selenium 2 Webinar: The Next Generation of Web and Mobile Application Testing After a bit of stagnation, the official Python drivers are starting to get updated again.</description>

      <description>You would think by now that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised by the number of links I collect in a week.
 The big news last week is that we (Selenium) have successfully avoided the whole Hudson/Jenkins drama by joining the Software Freedom Conservancy.  Se Announcement Conservancy Announcement   Speaking of Hudson/Jenkins, here is how to upgrade a Hudson install to Jenkinss I don&amp;#8217;t like a lot of the messaging of the whole &amp;#8216;Lean Startup&amp;#8217; scene, but they have some things to steal though.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the Software Freedom Conservancy. I&amp;#8217;m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We&amp;#8217;re now under the aegis of the SFC.
From most people&amp;#8217;s perspective, this won&amp;#8217;t make much difference: you&amp;#8217;ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from Selenium HQ.</description>

      <description>Hey look! All caught up &amp;#8212; only took a month&amp;#8230;
 My opinions on Continuous Deployment are pretty widely known, but the IMVU folks certainly have a lot of neat tricks to &amp;#8216;borrow&amp;#8217;. Such as Buildbot and Intermittent Tests Dealing with an API that returns XML? Your scripts don&amp;#8217;t care about the readibility, but it helps you as the human if it is formatted pretty. xml formatter is a glorious time save in that case.</description>

      <description>What a week! I&amp;#8217;m almost (almost!) sorry that the Bug Bash is over. I&amp;#8217;d like to say thank you to everyone involved in the Bug Bash, from those reporting issues, through those brave souls (Dharani, Anthony, Jari!) who went through the issue tracker, applied labels and made sure the issues were still fresh, all the way to those contributing fixes. And the top five bug fixers were?
 Jari Bakken (24 issues) Simon Stewart (21 issues) David Burns, aka: AutomatedTester (11 issues) Jim Evans (10 issues) Michael Tamm (6 issues)  Some interesting nuggets of information:</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re using Maven and the 2.0b1 release of Selenium, you may be running into some problems getting maven to pick up your tests. The underlying problem is that selenium contains support classes for both JUnit and TestNG. The solution is to add this to your pom.xml
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;selenium&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.0b1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;exclusions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.testng&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;testng&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/exclusions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Will today be the day I finish three weeks of catch-up? Well, no..
 UI Tests – putting it all together summarizes the series of posts using Watir and Cucumber, but the ideas could be converted to Se pretty easily. I haven&amp;#8217;t read it, but Essential Software Testdesign is now available for free [legitimately] as a pdf. Test Design is something I expect to see more discussion around in 2011 when it comes to Se automation.</description>

      <description>No. Really. I&amp;#8217;m almost caught up.
 Want input in a non-english language but don&amp;#8217;t want to convert your whole machine? InputKing might be able to help. And the fact it is in a browser means we can use it via Se. HAR (HTTP Archive) is the format the cool kids are talking about, and now there is a har gem so you can make use of HAR files in you [Ruby] scripts.</description>

      <description>When the Selenium and WebDriver projects merged, all those moons ago, we moved the infrastructure from something we hosted to Google Code. One reason for doing this was to make it easier for people to file bugs and feature requests. And it looks like people have been filing a lot of bugs and feature requests.
In the run up for the 2.0b2 release, we&amp;#8217;ll be running a Bug Bash. This will run from the 24th January all the way to the end of the 30th January.</description>

 Well, there is of course Selenium Conf is coming and you have until Friday to get your proposals in. Last I heard we had 37 which is impressive, but I think 50 should be doable. On the meetup side of things there is  Boston on January 25 NYC on January 26 (its not on the site yet, but I&amp;#8217;m speaking, so trust me, it exists) London on March 23   SeleniumCamp (English) is coming to Kiev at the end of February.</description>

      <description>My scheme for catching up with links last week ran afoul of 900 geeks and their families melting the internets at CodeMash 2.0.1.1. So let&amp;#8217;s try it again this week.
 Capturing screenshots on script failure is a common trick and Capturing Web Page Screenshots with Selenium 2 is the first post I have seen that explains how to do with with Selenium WebDriver XPath marks the spot uses a treasure map analogy around how to create good XPath &amp;#8212; but at the same time propagates the &amp;#8216;XPath is Inherently Evil&amp;#8217; myth.</description>

      <description>Second in a week-long series of catch-up posts. But before I get to the next batch of links, don&amp;#8217;t forget to submit your proposals to speak at the first Selenium Conference. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure we&amp;#8217;re going to be trying to pick out the talks next week.
 Can we please adopt this as the official poster for Selenium? Please?

      <description>As mentioned in Simon&amp;#8217;s Going Atomic: Why? and Going Atomic: How, part of the merging of Selenium and WebDriver is to share common code between the two. And as of the 1.0.10 release of Selenium IDE, this merged code, &amp;#8216;atoms&amp;#8217; is now included.
Some early users of this release are noticing that this the atom that drives assertAttribute and verifyAttribute is causing their scripts to break. This post explains the &amp;#8216;why&amp;#8217; and suggests how to fix them as well.</description>

We&amp;#8217;re still working out a lot of the details, but so far we&amp;#8217;ve decided this first conference will be sometime in April and hosted in San Francisco.
In order to figure out the rest of the details, we&amp;#8217;re looking for feedback from the Selenium user community. Please take a moment to fill out the following survey.</description>

 There is now a DZone &amp;#8216;refcard&amp;#8217; for Selenium 2.

We, as a community, need to document this sort of thing more. JUnit 4 Vs TestNG is a somewhat biased comparison between JUnit 4 and TestNG; but useful none the less.</description>

      <description>So we go from not-enough-stuff-to-do-one to wow-this-will-take-awhile. And we&amp;#8217;re off..
 Tellurium is one of the many frameworks that absorb Se and has an article on InfoQ called Introducing the Tellurium Automated Testing Framework which, well, introduces the framework. In the first of many Cucumber related posts this week is Sean Grove&amp;#8217;s Cucumber Sauce for doing parallel Cucumber runs on the Sauce infrastructure. Might be general enough to use outside of it as well.</description>

      <description>Seems I skipped a week, but that&amp;#8217;s okay since there hasn&amp;#8217;t been much in terms of volume (or maybe my clever search filter is a bit overly clever&amp;#8230;).
 The big news I think is that there is now a Se driver for Node.js called Soda. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I like the syntax, but I also don&amp;#8217;t claim to know Node so it could be idiomatically correct which is more important than my blessing.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Labour Day here, so this post was written to backdrop of Sponge Bob. In case you were wondering.
 selenium-java-evidence appears to be another logging framework, this time with an emphasis on auditability. Personally, the reports from a CI server should be all that are required, but to each their own&amp;#8230; taza is an opinionated browser-based test framework webdry is a Python (jquery-inspired) wrapper for DRY:er access to the Selenium WebDriver Self-testing AppEngine apps with Saucelabs seems like a cool little (if very low level) trick to using Se inside AppEngine Sauce Labs released their Getting Started With Selenium guide and is looking for feedback on it Need to interact with a web service during a BrowserMob run?</description>

      <description>A day late, but that sort of thing happens when you have family.
 I keep telling myself I will document how to incorporate Se launching and result recording in QC, but never seem to find the excuse. Looks like Aaron found the excuse: Finding the API for a DLL, Connecting to HP/Mercury Quality Center from a client side script Also from Aaron is a cool Credit Card Generator which has nice id tags which makes for easy Se parsing.</description>

      <description>A bit late, but I&amp;#8217;m in California for a Selenium Developers Meetup and my body doesn&amp;#8217;t quite know where it is temporally.
 Don&amp;#8217;t forget that tomorrow is the next meeting of the San Francisco Selenium folks which seems to be running a crowd sourced &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s stump Jason with our problems&amp;#8221; session. Most of the &amp;#8216;main&amp;#8217; Se folk will be there. Test design theory is something that I have yet to really see covered much, so here are three articles on the similar idea of what to test and what to skip.</description>

      <description>I was at Agile 2010 in Orlando last week so missed doing the Smattering, so here is two weeks worth of links.
 There is crazy amounts of power hiding in that there JUnit 4 library &amp;#8211; such as @Rule. One usage of them is described here. A useful pattern indeed when doing something like BDD or ATDD The next SFSE has been announced; August 24 at LinkedIn. Se creator Jason Huggins will be fielding questions in a Q&amp;amp;A session on steroids.</description>

      <description>The Selenium project does not have an &amp;#8216;official&amp;#8217; presence here at Agile as it is seen as a &amp;#8216;test after&amp;#8217; tool rather than &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; &amp;#8212; even though it provides the magic of the &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; frameworks&amp;#8230; But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.

      <description>The GSoC 2010, it’s a great adventure.
I’m Raynatou, I come from Burkina and do my internship at SERLI. Like all interns in this company the topic of my internship focuses on advanced topics like the integration of WebDriver as backend for Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE is currently built upon Selenium Core for interacting with web pages. Selenium Core has several major limitations, including the inability to fire native events. To avoid these limitations and produce more robust tests, I am investigating Selenium IDE to using WebDriver in place of Selenium Core.</description>

      <description>Happy Simcoe Day. Only a handful of links this week to mention.
 Kevin relaunched Mogotest &amp;#8211; see your website the way your users do. In a much earlier Smattering I think I linked to an announcement about a Se talk at Boston.rb. Well, here are the slides While not directly related to Se, the W3C has released their Unified Validator called, wait for it, Unicorn. So who is going to create the integration that magically sends pages to be validated there?</description>

      <description>I thought it had been a slow week &amp;#8212; until I looked at how many browser windows I had open. I wonder if that was why things were feeling a bit sluggish&amp;#8230;
Some bits of history from Simon Stewart  First announcement of Selenium (outside of Thoughtworks) First announcement of WebDriver (again, outside of Thoughtworks) The &amp;#8216;merger&amp;#8217; announcement (aka Selenium 2)   More history lessons on Cloud Computing Show #35 where Jason recounts the origin of Se (and other stuff) I still maintain that Continuous Deployment to production is near unethical, but a lot of the tricks that companies are using to support it are pretty cool.</description>

      <title>The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</title>

      <description>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better &amp;#8212; in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.
And then the confusion began. Let&amp;#8217;s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.
 There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.</description>

      <description>12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that&amp;#8217;s my excuse and I&amp;#8217;m sticking with it. Enjoy. I&amp;#8217;m going for a nap.
 The big news this week was the next alpha of Se 2 came out. Time to update those automation machines. Like TestNG&amp;#8217;s @BeforeClass and @AfterClass but using JUnit4? Using JUnit Nested Suites with Selenium RC to simulate TestNG suite and grouping annotations is a long titled post, but describes how to fake one out to act like the other.</description>

      <description>What’s new for Selenium this summer ? The GSoC of course !!!!
I’m Jérémy, a french engineer and I work at SERLI, a services company based in France.
I’m working on Selenium since a year and this summer I’m mentoring Aleksejs for the GSoC 2010. I’m helped by David Burns when I’m on vacation or offline. His experience is really useful to me, and David is involved on student supervising regularly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got a full day of driving ahead of me to go to a client so this is the early-morning (for me) edition of the Smattering post. That of course means there will be an absolute link explosion in about 20 minutes.
Dave talks about some of the stuff he is doing with Se-IDE in the post Improving Selenium IDE Another post on how to deal with file downloads in Se.</description>

      <description>Not too much this week with various holidays around the world, but still managed to dig some things up.
 Sauce Labs has started a webinar series and recently had one on using Cucumber and OnDemand. Cucumber and Robot Framework like tools are the coming wave of testing tools. Another bit of Sauce-ish news is the folks at Rally put up a post on how to get Se 2 scripts in their OnDemand cloud If writing Se scripts is &amp;#8216;programming&amp;#8217;, then writing the controlling frameworks is real programming.</description>

      <description>Here are the posts dealing with Se, and/or automation in general that caught my eye and interest.
 Selenium Unit Test Reuse illustrates one way of iterating through environments and browsers in a script without using Se-Grid. I&amp;#8217;ve done similar tricks to this to some success &amp;#8212; the problem is usually reporting though, but you are all clever folks so I&amp;#8217;m sure you could add it in. Adding a custom header is sometimes required when writing a script, but its not really that documented so Kevin wrote How to Perform Basic Authentication in Selenium which combines how to do basic auth and header injection.</description>

      <description>As you likely know by now, after years of stewardship Philippe has stepped down as maintainer of Selenium Grid and has named me the new maintainer. In this post, I hope to address the most immediate questions about what this means for the future of Selenium Grid.
Background I realize many of you may not know who I am. I&amp;#8217;ve been using Selenium in some capacity for close to five years now.</description>

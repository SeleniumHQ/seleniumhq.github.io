      <description>There are commands for various webpage loading actions:
Java Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Navigate to a URL (both of the statements below are // functionally equivalent). driver.get(&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;); driver.navigate().to(&amp;#34;https://www.google.com&amp;#34;); // Go forward one page in the browser (if you&amp;#39;re not on the // last page that was viewed). driver.navigate().forward(); // Go back one page in the browser (if you&amp;#39;re not on the // first page that was viewed). driver.navigate().back(); // Refresh the current page.</description>

      <description>First you need to install the Selenium bindings for your automation project. The installation process for libraries depends on the language you choose to use.
Java Installation of Selenium libraries for Java can be done using Maven. Add the selenium-java dependency in your project pom.xml:
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;selenium-java&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.X&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; The selenium-java dependency supports running your automation project with all Selenium supported browsers. If you want to run tests only in a specific browser, you can add the dependency for that browser in your pom.</description>

      <description>Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT*. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with that page of the UI. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves do not need to change; only the code within the page object needs to change.</description>

      <description>Selenium is not just one tool or API but it composes many tools.
WebDriver WebDriver is also known as Selenium 2. If you are beginning with desktop website test automation then you are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and run tests. This is as if a real user is operating the browser. Since WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application code, it is not intrusive in nature.</description>

      <description>The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to test. The server can be used either from the command line or through code configuration.
Starting the server from the command line Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar, place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from the directory with the jar, run the following:
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar Considerations for running the server The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.</description>

      <description>pageLoadStrategy When navigating to a new page via URL, by default Selenium will wait until the page has fully loaded before responding. This works well for beginners, but can cause long wait times on pages that load a large number of third party resources. Using a non default strategy can make test execution faster in cases like this, but can also introduce flakiness where elements on the page change position as elements load in and change size.</description>

      <description>Selenium controls web browsers Selenium is many things, but at its core it is a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the browser.
It allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.</description>

      <description>Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.
Terminology  API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of &amp;ldquo;commands&amp;rdquo; you use to manipulate WebDriver. Library: A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them.</description>

Each Selenium Grid consists of exactly one hub. The hub needs to be reachable from the respective clients (i.e. CI server, Developer machine etc.) The hub will connect one or more nodes that tests will be delegated to.</description>

      <description>A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.
Your users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty; they want to book travel to Alaska; they want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount.</description>

      <description>Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.
WebDriver&amp;rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers. For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies, please see Driver Idiosyncracies.</description>

      <description>Whilst it is possible to start a download by clicking a link with a browser under Selenium&amp;rsquo;s control, the API does not expose download progress, making it less than ideal for testing downloaded files. This is because downloading files is not considered an important aspect of emulating user interaction with the web platform. Instead, find the link using Selenium (and any required cookies) and pass it to a HTTP request library like libcurl.</description>

Common information  Combination of releases of geckodriver / firefox / selenium-html-runner matters. There might be a software compatibility matrix somewhere. selenium-html-runner runs only Test Suite (not Test Case - for example an export from Monitis Transaction Monitor). Be sure you comply with this. For Linux users with no DISPLAY - you need to start html-runner with Virtual display (search for xvfb)  Example Linux environment Install / download following software packages:</description>

      <description>First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser. Odds are that, at some point, if you are working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.
Functional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It is a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.</description>

      <description>To run a remote WebDriver client, we first need to connect to the RemoteWebDriver. We do this by pointing the URL to the address of the server running our tests. In order to customize our configuration, we set desired capabilities. Below is an example of instantiating a remote WebDriver object pointing to our remote web server, www.example.com, running our tests on Firefox.

      <description>Capitalisation of titles One should avoid title capitalisation, such as A Very Fine Heading, and instead go for A very fine heading. Gratutious capitalisation, or title case, often show a misunderstanding of – or a disregard for – orthographic conventions. We prefer what is known as sentence case, with a single initial capital to start headers.
Line length When editing the documentation’s source, which is written in plain HTML, limit your line lengths to around 72 characters.</description>

      <description>Selenium should not be used to prepare a test case. All repetitive actions and preparations for a test case, should be done through other methods. For example, most web UIs have authentication (e.g. a login form). Eliminating logging in via web browser before every test will improve both the speed and stability of the test. A method should be created to gain access to the AUT* (e.g. using an API to login and set a cookie).</description>

      <description>For some browser configurations in Selenium RC, Selenium acted as a proxy between the browser and the site being automated. This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.
Selenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user.</description>

      <description>If you plan to use Grid then you should download the selenium-server-standalone JAR file. The selenium-server-standalone jar is never uploaded, but all the components are available via selenium-server. The standalone JAR contains everything, including the remote Selenium server and the client-side bindings. This means that if you use the selenium-server-standalone jar in your project, you do not have to add selenium-java or a browser specific jar.

      <description>Locating one element One of the most fundamental techniques to learn when using WebDriver is how to find elements on the page. WebDriver offers a number of built-in selector types, amongst them finding an element by its ID attribute:
Java Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(&amp;#34;cheese&amp;#34;));   driver.find_element_by_id(&amp;#34;cheese&amp;#34;)   IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.Id(&amp;#34;cheese&amp;#34;));   driver.find_element(id: &amp;#34;cheese&amp;#34;)   const cheese = await driver.findElement(By.id(&amp;#39;cheese&amp;#39;));   val cheese: WebElement = driver.</description>

      <description>To use Selenium Grid, you need to maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes. As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort, many organizations use IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute to provide this infrastructure.
Other options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud. It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware.</description>

      <description>Acceptance testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product&amp;rsquo;s feature matches its requirements. This generally involves the customer&amp;rsquo;s feedback or specification.
For web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behaviour. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.</description>

      <description>Select elements can require quite a bit of boiler plate code to automate. To reduce this, and make your tests cleaner, there is a Select class in the Selenium support package. To use it, you will need the following import statement:
Java Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;   from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select   // We don&amp;#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don&amp;#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.</description>

      <description>These docs, like the code itself, are maintained 100% by volunteers within the Selenium community. Many have been using it since its inception, but many more have only been using it for a short while, and have given their time to help improve the on-boarding experience for new users.

      <description>For multiple reasons, logging into sites like Gmail and Facebook using WebDriver is not recommended. Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.
The ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth.</description>

      <description>WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver does not track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.
From experience, most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver are connected to race conditions that occur between the browser and the user&amp;rsquo;s instructions.</description>

      <description>Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit test frameworks is a good start. Most unit test frameworks have reports that can generate xUnit or HTML formatted reports. xUnit reports are popular for importing results to a Continuous Integration (CI) server like Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, etc. Here are some links for more information regarding report outputs for several languages.</description>

      <description>Although mentioned in several places it is worth mentioning again. Ensure tests are isolated from one another.
 Do not share test data. Imagine several tests that each query the database for valid orders before picking one to perform an action on. Should two tests pick up the same order you are likely to get unexpected behaviour.
 Clean up stale data in the application that might be picked up by another test e.</description>

      <description>WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup messages offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.
Alerts The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as the OK button.</description>

      <description>Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is generally not advised. Not because it is incapable, but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.
It may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself.</description>

      <description>Using WebDriver to spider through links is not a recommended practice. Not because it cannot be done, but because WebDriver is definitely not the most ideal tool for this. WebDriver needs time to start up, and can take several seconds, up to a minute depending on how your test is written, just to get to the page and traverse through the DOM.
Instead of using WebDriver for this, you could save a ton of time by executing a curl command, or using a library such as BeautifulSoup since these methods do not rely on creating a browser and navigating to a page.</description>

      <description>Write each test as its own unit. Write the tests in a way that will not be reliant on other tests to complete:
Let us say there is a content management system with which you can create some custom content which then appears on your website as a module after publishing, and it may take some time to sync between the CMS and the application.
A wrong way of testing your module is that the content is created and published in one test, and then checking the module in another test.</description>

      <description>Martin Fowler coined the term &amp;ldquo;Fluent API&amp;rdquo;. Selenium already implements something like this in their FluentWait class, which is meant as an alternative to the standard Wait class. You could enable the Fluent API design pattern in your page object and then query the Google search page with a code snippet like this one:
driver.get( &amp;#34;http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;amp;amp;tab=ww&amp;#34; ); GoogleSearchPage gsp = new GoogleSearchPage(); gsp.withFluent().setSearchString().clickSearchButton(); The Google page object class with this fluent behavior might look like this:</description>

      <description>Selenium is a big software project and documentation is key to understanding how things work and learning effective ways to exploit its potential.
Part of the documentation of Selenium is still served from our www.seleniumhq.org repository. We are however phasing out this documentation which focuses too much on Selenium RC and other antiquated pieces, in favour of this rewrite.
The new documentation is a project started to rewrite Selenium&amp;rsquo;s documentation from scratch.</description>

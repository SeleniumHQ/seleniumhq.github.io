A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with that page of the UI. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change; only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.\nThe Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantage: there is clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if you’re using a UI map) and layout.\nPage object methods should return a value  If you submit a page and are redirected, it should return the new page object. If you click submit on login and you want to check to see if a user is logged in, it should return True or False in a method.  "

The server can be used either from the command line or through code configuration.\nStarting the server from the command line Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar, place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from the directory with the jar, run the following:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar Considerations for running the server The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.\nThe selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session, which are cleared when Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit is called. If you forget to terminate these sessions, your server may leak memory. If you keep extremely long-running sessions, you will probably need to stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option).\nTimeouts (from version 2.21) The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60  browserTimeout  Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds).  timeout  Controls how long the client is allowed to be gone before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds).   The system property selenium.server.session.timeout is no longer supported as of 2.21.\nPlease note that the browserTimeout is intended as a backup timeout mechanism when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails, which should be used mostly in grid/server environments to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long, polluting the runtime environment.\nConfiguring the server programmatically In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the DriverServlet to a URL, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to host the page in a lightweight container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this follow.\nDownload the selenium-server.zip and unpack. Put the JARs on the CLASSPATH. Create a new class called AppServer. Here, I\u0026rsquo;m using Jetty, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download that as well:\nimport org.mortbay.jetty.Connector; import org.mortbay.jetty.Server; import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext; import javax.servlet.Servlet; import java.io.File; import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet; public class AppServer { private Server server = new Server(); public AppServer() throws Exception { WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext(); context.setContextPath(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); context.setWar(new File(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)); server.addHandler(context); context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, \u0026#34;/wd/*\u0026#34;); SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector(); connector.setPort(3001); server.addConnector(connector); server.start(); } }"

As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.\nTerminology  API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of \u0026ldquo;commands\u0026rdquo; you use to manipulate WebDriver. Library: A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc. Driver: Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not on the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies. Framework: An additional library used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for things such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.  The Parts and Pieces At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and receives information back via the same route.\nThe driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google\u0026rsquo;s Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may, or may not be, the same system where the tests themselves are executing.\nThis simple example above is direct communication. Communication to the browser may also be remote communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.\nRemote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system\nWhere Frameworks fit in WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about testing: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.\nThis is where various frameworks come in to play. At a minimum you\u0026rsquo;ll need a test framework that matches the language bindings, eg NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.\nThe test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.\nNatural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their own implementation.\n"

It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.\nYour users, in general, don\u0026rsquo;t care how your site looks. They don\u0026rsquo;t care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty. They want to book travel to Alaska. They want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as the tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you\u0026rsquo;re working on, such that the test scripts (the user\u0026rsquo;s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for and represent the user.\nWith Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).\nBenefits  Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it. Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication. Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality. Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT (application under test).  Java Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.\n/** * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;. * @return An instance of the AccountPage */ public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) { WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;loginField\u0026#34;)); loginField.clear(); loginField.sendKeys(username); // Fill out the password field. The locator we\u0026#39;re using is \u0026#34;By.id\u0026#34;, and we should  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;)); passwordField.clear(); passwordField.sendKeys(password); // Click the login button, which happens to have the id \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;.  driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;)).click(); // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium  // PageFactory).  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class); } This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all your tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.\npublic void loginTest() { loginAsUser(\u0026#34;cbrown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cl0wn3\u0026#34;); // Now that we\u0026#39;re logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support  // our testers, it\u0026#39;s as easy as choosing from available methods.  do.something(); do.somethingElse(); Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Something should have been done!\u0026#34;, something.wasDone()); // Note that we still haven\u0026#39;t referred to a button or web control anywhere in this  // script... } It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they don\u0026rsquo;t care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.\n"

Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.\nWebDriver\u0026rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers. For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies, please see Driver Idiosyncracies.\nEven though all the drivers share a single user-facing interface for controlling the browser, they have slightly different ways of setting up browser sessions. Since many of the driver implementations are provided by third parties, they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution.\nDriver instantiation, profile management, and various browser specific settings are examples of parameters that have different requirements depending on the browser. This section explains the basic requirements for getting you started with the different browsers.\nAdding Executables to your PATH Most drivers require an extra executable for Selenium to communicate with the browser. You can manually specify where the executable lives before starting WebDriver, but this can make your tests less portable, as the executables will need to be in the same place on every machine, or included within your test code repository.\nBy adding a folder containing WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s binaries to your system\u0026rsquo;s path, Selenium will be able to locate the additional binaries without requiring your test code to locate the exact location of the driver.\n Create a directory to place the executables in, like C:\\WebDriver\\bin or /opt/WebDriver/bin Add the directory to your PATH:  On Windows - Open a command prompt as administrator and the run the following command to permanently add the directory to your path for all users on your machine:   setx /m path \u0026#34;%path%;C:\\WebDriver\\bin\\\u0026#34;  Bash users on macOS and Linux - In a terminal:  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/WebDriver/bin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile  You are now ready to test your changes. Close all open command prompts and open a new one. Type out the name of one of the binaries in the folder you created in the previous step, e.g:  chromedriver  If your PATH is configured correctly, you will see some some output relating to the startup of the driver:  Starting ChromeDriver 2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1) on port 9515 Only local connections are allowed. You can regain control of your command prompt by pressing Ctrl + C\nQuick reference    Browser Supported OS Maintained by Download Issue Tracker     Chromium/Chrome Windows/macOS/Linux Google Downloads Issues   Firefox Windows/macOS/Linux Mozilla Downloads Issues   Edge Windows 10 Microsoft Downloads Issues   Internet Explorer Windows Selenium Project Downloads Issues   Safari macOS El Capitan and newer Apple Built in Issues   Opera Windows/macOS/Linux Opera Downloads Issues    Chromium/Chrome To drive Chrome or Chromium, you have to download chromedriver and put it in a folder that is on your system\u0026rsquo;s path.\nOn Linux or macOS, this means modifying the PATH environmental variable. You can see what directories, separated by a colon, make up your system\u0026rsquo;s path by executing the following command:\n$ echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin To include chromedriver on the path if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already, make sure you include the chromedriver binary\u0026rsquo;s parent directory. The following line will set the PATH environmental variable its current content, plus an additional path added after the colon:\n$ export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34; When chromedriver is available on your path, you should be able to execute the chromedriver executable from any directory.\nTo instantiate a Chrome/Chromium session, you can do the following:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Chrome driver = Chrome() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Chrome with Chrome() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); const chrome = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver/chrome\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;chrome\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver val driver: WebDriver = ChromeDriver()     Remember that you have to set the path to the chromedriver executable. This is possible using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Chrome(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;)   new ChromeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;   chrome.setDefaultService(new chrome.ServiceBuilder(\u0026#39;path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;).build());   System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;)     The chromedriver is implemented as a WebDriver remote server that by exposing Chrome\u0026rsquo;s internal automation proxy interface instructs the browser what to do.\nFirefox Starting with Selenium 3, Mozilla has taken over implementation of Firefox Driver, with geckodriver. The new driver for Firefox is called geckodriver and works with Firefox 48 and newer. Since the Firefox WebDriver is under development, the newer the Firefox version the better the support.\nAs geckodriver is the new default way of launching Firefox, you can instantiate Firefox in the same way as Selenium 2:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver; WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Firefox driver = Firefox() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Firefox with Firefox() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;firefox\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver val driver: WebDriver = FirefoxDriver()     If you prefer not to set geckodriver\u0026rsquo;s location using PATH, set the geckodriver binary location programmatically:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Firefox(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#39;)   new FirefoxDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;)     It is also possible to set the property at run time:\nmvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver It is currently possible to revert to the older, more feature complete Firefox driver, by installing Firefox 47.0.1 or 45 ESR and specifying a desired capability of marionette as false. Later releases of Firefox are no longer compatible.\nEdge Edge is Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s newest browser, included with Windows 10 and Server 2016. Updates to Edge are bundled with major Windows updates, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download a binary which matches the build number of your currently installed build of Windows. The Edge Developer site contains links to all the available binaries. Bugs against the EdgeDriver implementation can be raised with Microsoft. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to run tests against Edge, but aren\u0026rsquo;t running Windows 10, Microsoft offer free VMs for testers on the Edge Developer site.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver; WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Edge driver = Edge() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Edge with Edge() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Edge; IWebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :edge   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;MicrosoftEdge\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver val driver: WebDriver = EdgeDriver()     If Edge driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Edge(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#39;)   new EdgeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Edge.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Internet Explorer Internet Explorer was Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s default browser until Windows 10, although it is still included in Windows 10. Internet Explorer Driver is the only driver The Selenium project aims to support the same releases Microsoft considers current. Older releases may work, but will be unsupported.\nWhile the Selenium project provides binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer, there are some limitations with Internet Explorer 10 \u0026amp; 11 with the 64-bit driver, but using the 32-bit driver continues to work well. It should be noted that as Internet Explorer preferences are saved against the logged in user\u0026rsquo;s account, some additional setup is required.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver; WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Ie driver = Ie() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Ie with Ie() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.IE; IWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :internet_explorer   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;internet explorer\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver val driver: WebDriver = InternetExplorerDriver()     If Internet Explorer driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Ie(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe\u0026#39;)   new InternetExplorerDriver(\u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::IE.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Microsoft also offer a WebDriver binary for Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 \u0026amp; 8.1. It has not been updated since 2014 and is based of a draft version of the W3 specification. Jim Evans has an excellent writeup on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s implementation.\nOpera Current releases of Opera are built on top of the Chromium engine, and WebDriver is now supported via the closed-source Opera Chromium Driver, which can be added to your PATH or as a system property.\nInstantiating a driver session is similar to Firefox and Chromium:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver; WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Opera driver = Opera() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Opera with Opera() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Opera; IWebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver val driver: WebDriver = OperaDriver()     Safari Starting with Safari 10 on macOS El Capitan and Sierra, WebDriver support is included with each release of the browser. To enable support:\n Enable the Developer menu from Safari preferences Check the Allow Remote Automation option from with the Develop menu Run the following command from the terminal for the first time and type your password at the prompt to authorise WebDriver  /usr/bin/safaridriver -p 1337\u0026lt;/ You can then start a driver session using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver; WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Safari driver = Safari() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Safari with Safari() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Safari; IWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :safari   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;safari\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver val driver: WebDriver = SafariDriver()     Those looking to automate Safari on iOS should look to the Appium project. Whilst Safari was previously available for Windows, Apple has long since dropped support, making it a poor choice of test platform.\nMock browsers HtmlUnit HtmlUnit is a \u0026ldquo;GUI-Less browser for Java programs\u0026rdquo;. It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc. It has JavaScript support and is able to work with AJAX libraries, simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used. It has been moved to a new location. The source is maintained on svn.\nPhantomJS PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, albeit a version much older than that used by Google Chrome or Safari. Whilst historically a popular choice, it would now be wise to avoid PhantomJS. The project has been unmaintained since the 5th of August, so whilst the web will continue to change, PhantomJS will not be updated. This was after Google announced the ability to run Chrome headlessly, something also now offered by Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox.\n"

We do this by pointing the URL to the address of the server running our tests. In order to customize our configuration, we set desired capabilities. Below is an example of instantiating a remote WebDriver object pointing to our remote web server, www.example.com, running our tests on Firefox.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin FirefoxOptions firefoxOptions = new FirefoxOptions(); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, url: \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, desired_capabilities: :firefox driver.get \u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34; driver.close   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    firefoxOptions = FirefoxOptions() driver: WebDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;) driver.quit()     To further customize our test configuration, we can add other desired capabilities.\nDesired capabilities Desired capabilities can be expanded further. All remote Webdriver capabilities are sent through JsonWireProtocol. For a list of configurable capabilities, and more information on JsonWireProtocol, please visit the documentation here.\nFor example, suppose you wanted to run Chrome on Windows XP, using Chrome version 67:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome caps.platform = Windows XP caps.version = 67 driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, :desired_capabilities =\u0026gt; caps   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val chromeOptions = ChromeOptions() chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); val driver: WebDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;) driver.quit();     Local file detector The Local File Detector allows the transfer of files from the client machine to the remote server. For example, if a test needs to upload a file to a web application, a remote WebDriver can automatically transfer the file from the local machine to the remote web server during runtime. This allows the file to be uploaded from the remote machine running the test. It is not enabled by default and can be enabled in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.file_detector = lambda do |args| # args =\u0026gt; [\u0026#34;/path/to/file\u0026#34;] str = args.first.to_s str if File.exist?(str) end   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector())     Once the above code is defined, you can upload a file in your test in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;); WebElement upload = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)); upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.navigate.to \u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34; element = @driver.find_element(:id, \u0026#39;myfile\u0026#39;) element.send_keys \u0026#34;/Users/sso/SauceLabs/sauce/hostess/maitred/maitred/public/images/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;) val upload: WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)) upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;)     "

Gratutious capitalisation, or title case, often show a misunderstanding of – or a disregard for – orthographic conventions. We prefer what is known as sentence case, with a single initial capital to start headers.\nLine length When editing the documentation’s source, which is written in plain HTML, limit your line lengths to around 72 characters.\nSome of us take this one step further and use what is called semantic linefeeds, which is a technique whereby the HTML source lines, which are not read by the public, are split at ‘natural breaks’ in the prose. In other words, sentences are split at natural breaks between clauses. Instead of fussing with the lines of each paragraph so that they all end near the right margin, linefeeds can be added anywhere that there is a break between ideas.\nThis can make diffs very easy to read when collaborating through git, but it is not something we enforce contributors to use.\n"

Would it not be nice if there was an easy way to compare a HEX representation of a colour with a RGB representation of a colour, or a RGBA representation of a colour with a HSLA representation of a colour?\nWorry not. There is a solution: the Color class!\nFirst of all, you will need to import the class:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color;   from selenium.webdriver.support.color import Color   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color    You can now start creating colour objects. Every colour object will need to be created from a string representation of your colour. Supported colour representations are:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color HEX_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;#2F7ED8\u0026#34;); private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#34;); private final Color HSL_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#34;); private final Color HSLA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#34;);   HEX_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;#2F7ED8\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#39;) HSL_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#39;) HSLA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    HEX_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;#2F7ED8\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#39;) HSL_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#39;) HSLA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val HEX_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;#2F7ED8\u0026#34;) private val RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#34;) private val RGB_COLOUR_PERCENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#34;) private val RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#34;) private val RGBA_COLOUR_PERCENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#34;) private val HSL_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#34;) private val HSLA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#34;)     The Color class also supports all of the base colour definitions specified in http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#html4.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color BLACK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;black\u0026#34;); private final Color CHOCOLATE = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;chocolate\u0026#34;); private final Color HOTPINK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hotpink\u0026#34;);   BLACK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) CHOCOLATE = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;chocolate\u0026#39;) HOTPINK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hotpink\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    BLACK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) CHOCOLATE = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;chocolate\u0026#39;) HOTPINK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hotpink\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val BLACK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;black\u0026#34;) private val CHOCOLATE = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;chocolate\u0026#34;) private val HOTPINK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hotpink\u0026#34;)     Sometimes browsers will return a colour value of \u0026ldquo;transparent\u0026rdquo; if no colour has been set on an element. The Color class also supports this:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;);   TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;)     You can now safely query an element to get its colour/background colour knowing that any response will be correctly parsed and converted into a valid Color object:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin Color loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;); Color loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;);   login_button_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    login_button_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;) val loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;)     You can then directly compare colour objects:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK);   assert login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK))     Or you can convert the colour into one of the following formats and perform a static validation:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;);   assert login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;))     Colours are no longer a problem.\n"

	"content": " 首先，问问自己是否真的需要使用浏览器。 在某些情况下，如果您正在开发一个复杂的 web 应用程序， 您需要打开一个浏览器并进行实际测试，这种可能性是很大的。\n然而，诸如 Selenium 之类的功能性最终用户测试运行起来很昂贵。 此外，它们通常需要大量的基础设施才能有效运行。 经常问问自己，您想要测试的东西是否可以使用更轻量级的测试方法（如单元测试）完成， 还是使用较低级的方法完成，这是一个很好的规则。\n一旦确定您正在进行Web浏览器测试业务， 并且您的 Selenium 环境已经准备好开始编写测试， 您通常会执行以下三个步骤的组合：\n 设置数据 执行一组离散的操作 评估结果  您需要尽可能缩短这些步骤; 一到两个操作在大多数时间内应该足够了。 浏览器自动化具有“脆弱”的美誉， 但实际上那是因为用户经常对它要求过高。 在后面的章节中，我们将回到您可以使用的技术， 为了缓解测试中明显的间歇性问题， 特别是如何克服 浏览器 和 WebDriver 之间的竞争条件。\n通过保持测试简短并仅在您完全没有替代方案时使用Web浏览器，您可以用最小的代码片段来完成很多测试。\nSelenium测试的一个显著优势是，它能够从用户的角度测试应用程序的所有组件（从后端到前端）。 因此，换句话说，虽然功能测试运行起来可能很昂贵，但它们同时也包含了大量关键业务部分。\n测试要求 如前所述，Selenium 测试运行起来可能很昂贵。 在多大程度上取决于您正在运行测试的浏览器， 但历史上浏览器的行为变化太大，以至于通常是针对多个浏览器进行交叉测试的既定目标。\nSelenium 允许您在多个操作系统上的多个浏览器上运行相同的指令， 但是对所有可能的浏览器、它们的不同版本以及它们所运行的许多操作系统的枚举将很快成为一项繁重的工作。\n让我们从一个例子开始 Larry 写了一个网站，允许用户订购他们自己定制的独角兽。\n一般的工作流程(我们称之为“幸福之路”)是这样的:\n 创建一个账户 配置他们的独角兽 添加到购物车 检验并付款 给出关于他们独角兽的反馈  编写一个宏大的 Selenium 脚本来执行所有这些操作是很诱人的 — 很多人都会尝试这样做。 抵制诱惑！ 这样做会导致测试: a) 需要很长时间; b) 会受到一些与页面呈现时间问题有关的常见问题的影响; c) 如果失败，它不会给出一个简洁的、“可检查”的方法来诊断出了什么问题。\n测试此场景的首选策略是将其分解为一系列独立的、快速的测试，每个测试都有一个存在的“理由”。\n假设您想测试第二步： 配置您的独角兽。 它将执行以下操作:\n 创建一个帐户 配置一个独角兽  请注意，我们跳过了这些步骤的其余部分， 在完成这一步之后，我们将在其他小的、离散的测试用例中测试工作流的其余部分。\n首先，您需要创建一个帐户。在这里您可以做出一些选择：\n 您想使用现有帐户吗？ 您想创建一个新帐户吗？ 在配置开始之前，是否需要考虑有任何特殊属性的用户需要吗？  不管您如何回答这个问题， 解决方案是让它成为测试中“设置数据”部分的一部分 - 如果 Larry 公开了一个 API， 使您(或任何人)能够创建和更新用户帐户， 一定要用它来回答这个问题 请确保使用这个 API 来回答这个问题 — 如果可能的话， 您希望只有在您拥有一个用户之后才启动浏览器，您可以使用该用户的凭证进行登录。\n如果每个工作流的每个测试都是从创建用户帐户开始的，那么每个测试的执行都会增加许多秒。 调用 API 并与数据库进行通信是快速、“无头”的操作， 不需要打开浏览器、导航到正确页面、点击并等待表单提交等昂贵的过程。\n理想情况下，您可以在一行代码中处理这个设置阶段，这些代码将在任何浏览器启动之前执行:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. User user = UserFactory.createCommonUser(); //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. AccountPage accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());   # Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, # but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have # administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email # address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to # know them. user = user_factory.create_common_user() #This method is defined elsewhere. # Log in as this user. # Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the # AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then # perform actions from the AccountPage. account_page = login_as(user.get_email(), user.get_password())   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. val user = UserFactory.createCommonUser() //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. val accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword())     您可以想象，UserFactory可以扩展为提供诸如createAdminUser()、createUserWithPayment()的方法。 关键是，这两行代码不会分散您对此测试的最终目的的注意力： 配置独角兽。\n页面对象模型 的复杂性将在后面的章节中讨论，但我们将在这里介绍这个概念：\n您的测试应该由操作组成，从用户的角度出发，在站点的页面上下文中执行。 这些页面被存储为对象， 其中包含关于 web 页面如何组成以及如何执行操作的特定信息 — 作为测试人员，您应该很少关注这些信息。\n您想要什么样的独角兽？ 您可能想要粉红色，但不一定。 紫色最近很流行。 她需要太阳镜吗？ 明星纹身？ 这些选择虽然困难，但是作为测试人员， 您的主要关注点是 — 您需要确保您的订单履行中心将正确的独角兽发送给正确的人，而这就要从这些选择开始。\n请注意，我们在该段落中没有讨论按钮，字段，下拉菜单，单选按钮或 Web 表单。 您的测试也不应该！ 您希望像尝试解决问题的用户一样编写代码。 这是一种方法（从前面的例子继续）：\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. // This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact // with the browser in any way.

Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;, unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles));   # The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles # object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare # them with the fields on the page. assert unicorn_confirmation_page.exists(sparkles), \u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles // object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare // them with the fields on the page. //CHECK Boris assertTrue(\u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;, unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles))     请注意，测试人员在这段代码中除了谈论独角兽之外还没有做任何事情 — 没有按钮、定位器和浏览器控件。 这种对应用程序建模的方法允许您保持这些测试级别的命令不变， 即使 Larry 下周决定不再喜欢 Ruby-on-Rails， 并决定用最新的带有 Fortran 前端的 Haskell 绑定重新实现整个站点。\n为了符合站点的重新设计，您的页面对象需要进行一些小的维护，但是这些测试将保持不变。 采用这一基本设计，您将希望继续使用尽可能少的面向浏览器的步骤来完成您的工作流。 您的下一个工作流程将包括在购物车中添加独角兽。 您可能需要多次迭代此测试，以确保购物车正确地保持其状态： 在开始之前，购物车中是否有多个独角兽？ 购物车能装多少？ 如果您创建多个具有相同名称或特性，它会崩溃吗？ 它将只保留现有的一个还是添加另一个?\n每次通过工作流时，您都希望尽量避免创建帐户、以用户身份登录和配置独角兽。 理想情况下，您将能够创建一个帐户，并通过 API 或数据库预先配置独角兽。 然后，您只需作为用户登录，找到 Sparkles，并将它添加到购物车中。\n"

If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.getWindowHandle();  driver.current_window_handle  driver.CurrentWindowHandle;   driver.window_handle  await driver.getWindowHandle();   driver.getWindowHandle()    Switching windows or tabs Clicking a link which opens in a new window will focus the new window or tab on screen, but WebDriver will not know which window the Operating System considers active. To work with the new window you will need to switch to it. If you have only two tabs or windows open, and you know which window you start with, by the process of elimination you can loop over both windows or tabs that WebDriver can see, and switch to the one which is not the original.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Store the ID of the original window String originalWindow = driver.getWindowHandle(); //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert driver.getWindowHandles().size() == 1; //Click the link which opens in a new window driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;)).click();

Assuming you followed the code sample in the previous section you will have the previous window handle stored in a variable. Put this together and you will get:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Close the tab or window driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close() #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window(original_window)   //Close the tab or window driver.Close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.SwitchTo().Window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window original_window   //Close the tab or window await driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window await driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   //Close the tab or window driver.close() //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow)     Forgetting to switch back to another window handle after closing a window will leave WebDriver executing on the now closed page, and will trigger a No Such Window Exception. You must switch back to a valid window handle in order to continue execution.\nQuitting the browser at the end of a session When you are finished with the browser session you should call quit, instead of close:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.quit();  driver.quit()  driver.Quit();   driver.quit  await driver.quit();   driver.quit()     Quit will:  Close all the windows and tabs associated with that WebDriver session The browser process The background driver process Notify Selenium Grid that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session (if you are using Selenium Grid)   Failure to call quit will leave extra background processes and ports running on your machine which could cause you problems later.\nSome test frameworks offer methods and annotations which you can hook into to tear down at the end of a test.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll public static void tearDown() { driver.quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   /* Example using Visual Studio\u0026#39;s UnitTesting https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.aspx */ [TestCleanup] public void TearDown() { driver.Quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   /** * Example using Mocha * https://mochajs.org/#hooks */ after(\u0026#39;Tear down\u0026#39;, async function () { await driver.quit(); });   /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll fun tearDown() { driver.quit() }     If not running WebDriver in a test context, you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit(); }   try: #WebDriver code here... finally: driver.quit()   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.Quit(); }   begin #WebDriver code here... ensure driver.quit end   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { await driver.quit(); }   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit() }     Python\u0026rsquo;s WebDriver now supports the python context manager, which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution.\nwith webdriver.Firefox() as driver: # WebDriver code here... # WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation Frames and Iframes Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain. You are unlikely to work with them unless you are working with an pre HTML5 webapp. Iframes allow the insertion of a document from an entirely different domain, and are still commonly used.\nIf you need to work with frames or iframes, Webdriver allows you to work with them in the same way. Consider a button within an iframe. If we inspect the element using the browser development tools, we might see the following:\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;modal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe id=\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/iframe.html\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Click here\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the iframe we would expect to click on the button using something like:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # This Wont work driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # This won\u0026#39;t work driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // This won\u0026#39;t work await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     However, if there are no buttons outside of the iframe, you might instead get a no such element error. This happens because Selenium is only aware of the elements in the top level document. To interact with the button, we will need to first switch to the frame, in a similar way to how we switch windows. WebDriver offers three ways of switching to a frame.\nUsing a WebElement Switching using a WebElement is the most flexible option.

Eliminating logging in via web browser before every test will improve both the speed and stability of the test. A method should be created to gain access to the AUT (e.g. using an API to login and set a cookie). Also, creating methods to pre-load data for testing should not be done using Selenium.

This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.\nSelenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user and this is represented in the way you write tests with WebDriver. In automated functional testing, checking the status code is not a particularly important detail of a test\u0026rsquo;s failure; the steps that preceded it are more important.\nThe browser will always represent the HTTP status code, imagine for example a 404 or a 500 error page. A simple way to “fail fast” when you encounter one of these error pages is to check the page title or content of a reliable point (e.g. the \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag) after every page load. If you are using the page object model, you can include this check in your class constructor or similar point where the page load is expected. Occasionally, the HTTP code may even be represented in the browser\u0026rsquo;s error page and you could use WebDriver to read this and improve your debugging output.\nChecking the webpage itself is in line with WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s ideal practice of representing and asserting upon the user’s view of the website.\nIf you insist, an advanced solution to capturing HTTP status codes is to replicate the behaviour of Selenium RC by using a proxy. WebDriver API provides the ability to set a proxy for the browser, and there are a number of proxies that will programmatically allow you to manipulate the contents of requests sent to and received from the web server. Using a proxy lets you decide how you want to respond to redirection response codes. Additionally, not every browser makes the response codes available to WebDriver, so opting to use a proxy allows you to have a solution that works for every browser.\n"

	"content": "  页面需要从英语翻译为简体中文。 您熟悉英语与简体中文吗？帮助我们翻译它，通过 pull requests 给我们！\n Locating one element One of the most fundamental techniques to learn when using WebDriver is how to find elements on the page. WebDriver offers a number of built-in selector types, amongst them finding an element by its ID attribute:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)   IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)   const cheese = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;));   val cheese: WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;))     As seen in the example, locating elements in WebDriver is done on the WebDriver instance object. The findElement(By) method returns another fundamental object type, the WebElement.\n WebDriver represents the browser WebElement represents a particular DOM node (a control, e.g. a link or input field, etc.)  Once you have a reference to a web element that\u0026rsquo;s been “found”, you can narrow the scope of your search by using the same call on that object instance:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)); WebElement cheddar = cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheese = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;) cheddar = cheese.find_elements_by_id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   IWebElement cheese = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)); IWebElement cheddar = cheese.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheese = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;) cheddar = cheese.find_elements(id: \u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheese = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;)); const cheddar = await cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheddar\u0026#39;));   val cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)) val cheddar = cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;))     You can do this because both the WebDriver and WebElement types implement the SearchContext interface. In WebDriver, this is known as a role-based interface. Role-based interfaces allow you to determine whether a particular driver implementation supports a given feature. These interfaces are clearly defined and try to adhere to having only a single role of responsibility. You can read more about WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s design and what roles are supported in which drivers in the Some Other Section Which Must Be Named. Consequently, the By interface used above also supports a number of additional locator strategies. A nested lookup might not be the most effective cheese location strategy since it requires two separate commands to be issued to the browser; first searching the DOM for an element with ID “cheese”, then a search for “cheddar” in a narrowed context.\nTo improve the performance slightly, we should try to use a more specific locator: WebDriver supports looking up elements by CSS locators, allowing us to combine the two previous locators into one search:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheddar = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;)   driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheddar = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#39;));   driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;))     Locating multiple elements It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the document we are working with may turn out to have an ordered list of the cheese we like the best:\n\u0026lt;ol id=cheese\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li id=cheddar\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=brie\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=rochefort\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=camembert\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; Since more cheese is undisputably better, and it would be cumbersome to have to retrieve each of the items individually, a superior technique for retrieving cheese is to make use of the pluralized version findElements(By). This method returns a collection of web elements. If only one element is found, it will still return a collection (of one element). If no element matches the locator, an empty list will be returned.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; muchoCheese = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;)   IReadOnlyList\u0026lt;IWebElement\u0026gt; muchoCheese = driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(“#cheese li”));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;)   const muchoCheese = await driver.findElements(By.css(\u0026#39;#cheese li\u0026#39;));   val muchoCheese: List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;))     Element selection strategies There are eight different built-in element location strategies in WebDriver:\n   Locator Description     class name Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)   css selector Locates elements matching a CSS selector   id Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value   name Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value   link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value   partial link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value   tag name Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value   xpath Locates elements matching an XPath expression    Tips on using selectors In general, if HTML IDs are available, unique, and consistently predictable, they are the preferred method for locating an element on a page. They tend to work very quickly, and forego much processing that comes with complicated DOM traversals.\nIf unique IDs are unavailable, a well-written CSS selector is the preferred method of locating an element. XPath works as well as CSS selectors, but the syntax is complicated and frequently difficult to debug. Though XPath selectors are very flexible, they are typically not performance tested by browser vendors and tend to be quite slow.\nSelection strategies based on link text and partial link text have drawbacks in that they only work on link elements. Additionally, they call down to XPath selectors internally in WebDriver.\nTag name can be a dangerous way to locate elements. There are frequently multiple elements of the same tag present on the page. This is mostly useful when calling the findElements(By) method which returns a collection of elements.\nThe recommendation is to keep your locators as compact and readable as possible. Asking WebDriver to traverse the DOM structure is an expensive operation, and the more you can narrow the scope of your search, the better.\n"

As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort, many organizations use IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute to provide this infrastructure.\nOther options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud. It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware. This chapter will go into detail about the option of running your own grid, complete with its own node infrastructure.\nQuick start This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Grid Hub, and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node. We’ll also show you how to call the grid from Java. The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine, but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.\nThe selenium-server-standalone package includes the hub, WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the Grid, ant is not required anymore. You can download the selenium-server-standalone-.jar from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.\nStep 1: Start the Hub The Hub is the central point that will receive test requests and distribute them to the right nodes. The distribution is done on a capabilities basis, meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.\nBecause a test\u0026rsquo;s desired capabilities are just what the name implies, desired, the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone.jar file. You start the hub by passing the -role hub flag to the standalone server:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub The Hub will listen to port 4444 by default. You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to http://localhost:4444/grid/console.\nTo change the default port, you can add the optional -port flag with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command. Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below) are possible command-line flags.\nYou certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above, but if you need more advanced configuration, then you may also for convenience specify a JSON format config file to configure the hub when you start it. You can do it like so:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug Below you will see an example of a hubConfig.json file. We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.\n{ \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;cleanupCycle\u0026#34;: 5000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 300000, \u0026#34;newSessionWaitTimeout\u0026#34;: -1, \u0026#34;servlets\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;prioritizer\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;capabilityMatcher\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;throwOnCapabilityNotPresent\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;nodePolling\u0026#34;: 180000, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;} Step 2: Start the Nodes Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality, or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality, or both at the same time, you use the same selenium-server-standalone.jar file to start the nodes:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444 If a port is not specified through the -port flag, a free port will be chosen. You can run multiple nodes on one machine but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory resources and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.\nConfiguration of Node with options As mentioned, for backwards compatibility “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role. But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.\nPassing JVM properties (using the -D flag before the -jar argument) on the command line as well, and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:\n-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe\nConfiguration of Node with JSON You can also start grid nodes that are configured with a JSON configuration file\njava -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json And here is an example of a nodeConfig.json file:\n{ \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;acceptSslCerts\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;javascriptEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;takesScreenshot\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;firefox_profile\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;browser-version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;firefox_binary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanSession\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chrome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;internet explorer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanUpCycle\u0026#34;: 2000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 30000, \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 5555, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;register\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;hubPort\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5 } } A note about the -host flag\nFor both hub and node, if the -host flag is not specified, 0.0.0.0 will be used by default. This will bind to all the public (non-loopback) IPv4 interfaces of the machine. If you have a special network configuration or any component that creates extra network interfaces, it is advised to set the -host flag with a value that allows the hub/node to be reachable from a different machine.\nSpecifying the port The default TCP/IP port used by the hub is 4444. If you need to change the port please use above mentioned configurations\nTroubleshooting Using Log file For advance troubleshooting you can specify log file to log system messages. For that start Selenium GRID hub or node with -log argument. Please see the below example\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -log log.txt Use your favorite text editor to open log file (log.txt in above example) to find \u0026ldquo;ERROR\u0026rdquo; logs if you get issues.\nUsing -debug argument Also you can use -debug argument to print debug logs on console. For that start Selenium Grid Hub or Node with -debug argument. Please see the below example\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -debug Warning The Selenium Grid must be protected from external access using appropriate firewall permissions.\nFailure to protect your Grid could result in one or more of the following occurring: * You provide open access to your Grid infrastructure * You allow 3rd parties to access internal web applications and files * You allow 3rd parties to run custom binaries\nSee this blog post on Detectify which gives a good overview of how a publicly exposed Grid could be misused: Don\u0026rsquo;t Leave your Grid Wide Open.\nDocker Selenium Docker provides a convenient way to provision and scale Selenium Grid infrastructure in a unit known as a container. Containers are standardised units of software that contain everything required to run the desired application including all dependencies in a reliable and repeatable way on different machines.\nThe Selenium project maintains a set of Docker images which you can download and run to get a working grid up and running quickly. Nodes are available for both Firefox and Chrome. Full details of how to provision a grid can be found within the Docker Selenium repository.\nPrerequisite The only requirement to run a Grid is to have Docker installed and working. Install Docker.\n"

This generally involves the customer\u0026rsquo;s feedback or specification.\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behavior. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.\nFunctional testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature functions properly, without issues.\nThis generally include: the tests work without errors (404, exceptions\u0026hellip;), in an usable way (right redirections), in an accessible way and matching its specifications (see acceptance testing above).\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating expected returns. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explainedin this documentation.\nPerformance testing As its name indicates, performance tests are done in order to measure how well an application is performing.\nThere are two main sub-types for performance testing:\nLoad testing Load testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under different defined loads (usually a particular number of users connected at once)\nStress testing Stress testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under stress (or above the maximum supported load).\nGenerally, performance tests are done by executing a number of Selenium written tests simulating different users hitting a particular function on the web app and retrieving some meaningful measurements.\nThis is generally done by other tools that retrieve the metrics. One such tools is JMeter.\nFor a web application, details to measure include: throughput, latency, data loss, individual component loading times\u0026hellip;\nNote: All browsers have a performance tab in their developers\u0026rsquo; tools section (accessible by pressing F12)\nNote 2: is a subtype of non-functional testing as this is generally measured per system and not per function/feature.\nRegression testing This testing is generally done after a change, fix or feature addition.\nIn order to ensure that the change has not broken any of the existing functionality, some already executed tests are executed again.\nThe set of re-executed test can be full or partial and can include several different types, depending on the application and development team.\nTest driven development (TDD) Rather than a test type per se, TDD is an iterative development methodology in which tests drive the design of a feature.\nEach cycle starts by creating a set of unit tests that the feature should pass (which should fail their first time executed).\nAfter this, development takes place in order to make the tests pass. The tests are executed again starting another cycle and this process continues until all tests are passing.\nThis aims to speed up the development of an application based on the fact that defects are less costly the earlier they are found.\nBehavior-driven development (BDD) BDD is also an iterative development methodology based on above (TDD) in which the goal is to involve all the parties in the development of an application.\nEach cycle starts by creating some specification (which should fail). Then create the failing unit tests (which should also fail) and then create the development.\nThis cycle is repeated until all type of tests are passing.\nIn order to do so, a specification language is used. It should be understandable by all parties and simple, standard and explicit. Most tools use Gherkin as this language.\nThe goal is to be able to detect even more errors than TDD by targeting potential acceptance errors too and make communication between parties smoother.\nA set of tools are currently available in order to write the specifications and match them with code functions, such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.\nA set of tools are built on top of Selenium to make this process even faster by directly transform the BDD specifications into executable code. Some of these are: JBehave, Capybara and Robot Framework.\n"

To reduce this and make your tests cleaner, there is a Select class in the Selenium support package. To use it, you will need the following import statement:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;   from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select     You are then able to create a Select object using a WebElement that references a \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement selectElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;selectElementID\u0026#34;)); Select selectObject = new Select(selectElement);   select_element = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;selectElementID\u0026#39;) select_object = Select(select_element)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    select_element = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;selectElementID\u0026#39;) select_object = Select(select_element)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val selectElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;selectElementID\u0026#34;)) val selectObject = new Select(selectElement)     The Select object will now give you a series of commands that allow you to interact with a \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element. First of all, there are different ways of selecting an option from the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element.\n\u0026lt;select\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value1\u0026gt;Bread\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value2 selected\u0026gt;Milk\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value3\u0026gt;Cheese\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/select\u0026gt; There are three ways to select the first option from the above element:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Select an \u0026lt;option\u0026gt;

based upon its text selectObject.selectByVisibleText(\u0026#34;Bread\u0026#34;)     You can then check which options are selected by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return a List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; of options that have been selected List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; allSelectedOptions = selectObject.getAllSelectedOptions(); // Return a WebElement referencing the first selection option found by walking down the DOM WebElement firstSelectedOption = selectObject.getFirstSelectedOption();

elements the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element contains:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return a List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; of options that the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element contains List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt;

elements allow you to select more than one option. You can find out if your \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element is one of these by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin Boolean doesThisAllowMultipleSelections = selectObject.isMultiple();   does_this_allow_multiple_selections = select_object.is_multiple   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    does_this_allow_multiple_selections = select_object.multiple?   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val doesThisAllowMultipleSelections = selectObject.isMultiple     "

Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.\nThe ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth. Although using an API might seem like a bit of extra hard work, you will be paid back in speed, reliability, and stability. The API is also unlikely to change whereas webpages and HTML locators change often and require you to update your test framework.\nLogging in to third party sites using WebDriver at any point of your test increases the risk of your test failing because it makes your test longer. A general rule of thumb is that longer tests are more fragile and unreliable.\nWebDriver implementations that are W3C conformant also annotate the navigator object with a webdriver property so that Denial of Service attacks can be mitigated.\n"

	"content": "  页面需要从英语翻译为简体中文。 您熟悉英语与简体中文吗？帮助我们翻译它，通过 pull requests 给我们！\n WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.\nFrom experience, most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver are connected to race conditions that occur between the browser and the user\u0026rsquo;s instructions. An example could be that the user instructs the browser to navigate to a page, then gets a no such element error when trying to find an element.\nConsider the following document:\n\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=utf-8\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Race Condition Example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var initialised = false; window.addEventListener(\u0026#34;load\u0026#34;, function() { var newElement = document.createElement(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); newElement.textContent = \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(newElement); initialised = true; }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The WebDriver instructions might look innocent enough:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.Text, \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox begin # Navigate to URL driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; # Get and store Paragraph Text search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert(element.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     The issue here is that the default page load strategy used in WebDriver listens for the document.readyState to change to \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot; before returning from the call to navigate. Because the p element is added after the document has completed loading, this WebDriver script might be intermittent. It “might” be intermittent because no guarantees can be made about elements or events that trigger asynchronously without explicitly waiting—or blocking—on those events.\nFortunately, using the normal instruction set available on the WebElement interface—such as WebElement.click and _WebElement.sendKeys_—are guaranteed to be synchronous, in that the function calls won\u0026rsquo;t return (or the callback won\u0026rsquo;t trigger in callback-style languages) until the command has been completed in the browser. The advanced user interaction APIs, Keyboard and Mouse, are exceptions as they are explicitly intended as “do what I say” asynchronous commands.\nWaiting is having the automated task execution elapse a certain amount of time before continuing with the next step.\nTo overcome the problem of race conditions between the browser and your WebDriver script, most Selenium clients ship with a wait package. When employing a wait, you are using what is commonly referred to as an explicit wait.\nExplicit wait Explicit waits are available to Selenium clients for imperative, procedural languages. They allow your code to halt program execution, or freeze the thread, until the condition you pass it resolves. The condition is called with a certain frequency until the timeout of the wait is elapsed. This means that for as long as the condition returns a falsy value, it will keep trying and waiting.\nSince explicit waits allow you to wait for a condition to occur, they make a good fit for synchronising the state between the browser and its DOM, and your WebDriver script.\nTo remedy our buggy instruction set from earlier, we could employ a wait to have the findElement call wait until the dynamically added element from the script has been added to the DOM:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER); // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds WebElement firstResult = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); // Print the first result System.out.println(firstResult.getText());   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait def document_initialised(driver): return driver.execute_script(\u0026#34;return initialised\u0026#34;) driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) WebDriverWait(driver).until(document_initialised) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.Url = \u0026#34;https://www.google.com/ncr\u0026#34;; driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).SendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.Enter); WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); IWebElement firstResult = wait.Until(e =\u0026gt; e.FindElement(By.XPath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); Console.WriteLine(firstResult.Text);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout =\u0026gt; 10) def document_initialised(driver) driver.execute_script(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;) end begin driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; wait.until{document_initialised driver} search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   const documentInitialised = () =\u0026gt; driver.executeScript(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;); await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); await driver.wait(() =\u0026gt; documentInitialised(), 10000); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;) driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER) // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds val firstResult = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))) // Print the first result println(firstResult.text)     We pass in the condition as a function reference that the wait will run repeatedly until its return value is truthy. A “truthful” return value is anything that evaluates to boolean true in the language at hand, such as a string, number, a boolean, an object (including a WebElement), or a populated (non-empty) sequence or list. That means an empty list evaluates to false. When the condition is truthful and the blocking wait is aborted, the return value from the condition becomes the return value of the wait.\nWith this knowledge, and because the wait utility ignores no such element errors by default, we can refactor our instructions to be more concise:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement foo = new WebDriverWait(driver, 3) .until(driver -\u0026gt; driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;))); assertEquals(foo.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = WebDriverWait(driver).until(lambda d: return d.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val ele = WebDriverWait(getWebDriver(), 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;))) assert(ele.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     In that example, we pass in an anonymous function (but we could also define it explicitly as we did earlier so it may be reused). The first and only argument that is passed to our condition is always a reference to our driver object, WebDriver (called d in the example). In a multi-threaded environment, you should be careful to operate on the driver reference passed in to the condition rather than the reference to the driver in the outer scope.\nBecause the wait will swallow no such element errors that are raised when the element isn\u0026rsquo;t found, the condition will retry until the element is found. Then it will take the return value, a WebElement, and pass it back through to our script.\nIf the condition fails, e.g. a truthful return value from the condition is never reached, the wait will throw/raise an error/exception called a timeout error.\nOptions The wait condition can be customised to match your needs. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary to wait the full extent of the default timeout, as the penalty for not hitting a successful condition can be expensive.\nThe wait lets you pass in an argument to override the timeout:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //new WebDriverWait(driver,3).until(some_condition(WebElement)) new WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=3).until(some_condition)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)))     Expected conditions Because it\u0026rsquo;s quite a common occurrence to have to synchronise the DOM and your instructions, most clients also come with a set of predefined expected conditions. As might be obvious by the name, they are conditions that are predefined for frequent wait operations.\nThe conditions available in the different language bindings vary, but this is a non-exhaustive list of a few:\n alert is present element exists element is visible title contains title is element staleness visible text  You can refer to the API documentation for each client binding to find an exhaustive list of expected conditions:\n Java\u0026rsquo;s org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions class Python\u0026rsquo;s selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions class .NET\u0026rsquo;s OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.ExpectedConditions type  Implicit wait There is a second type of wait that is distinct from explicit wait called implicit wait. By implicitly waiting, WebDriver polls the DOM for a certain duration when trying to find any element. This can be useful when certain elements on the webpage are not available immediately and need some time to load.\nImplicit waiting for elements to appear is disabled by default and will need to be manually enabled on a per-session basis. Mixing explicit waits and implicit waits will cause unintended consequences, namely waits sleeping for the maximum time even if the element is available or condition is true.\nWarning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.\nAn implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0, meaning disabled. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;); WebElement myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;));   driver = Firefox() driver.implicitly_wait(10) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) my_dynamic_element = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;)   IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitWait = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); driver.Url = \u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;; IWebElement dynamicElement = driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;dynamicElement\u0026#34;));   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox driver.manage.timeouts.implicit_wait = 10 begin driver.get \u0026#39;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#39; search_form = driver.find_element(:id,\u0026#39;dynamic_element\u0026#39;) ensure driver.quit end   (async function(){ // Apply timeout for 10 seconds await driver.manage().setTimeouts( { implicit: 10000 } ); // Navigate to url await driver.get(\u0026#39;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#39;); let webElement = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;)); }());   val driver = FirefoxDriver() driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) val myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;))     FluentWait FluentWait instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the condition.\nUsers may configure the wait to ignore specific types of exceptions whilst waiting, such as NoSuchElementException when searching for an element on the page.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking // for its presence once every 5 seconds. Wait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt; wait = new FluentWait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt;(driver) .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5)) .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class); WebElement foo = wait.until(new Function\u0026lt;WebDriver, WebElement\u0026gt;() { public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) { return driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;)); } });   driver = Firefox() driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10, poll_frequency=1, ignored_exceptions=[ElementNotVisibleException, ElementNotSelectableException]) element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, \u0026#34;//div\u0026#34;)))   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val wait = FluentWait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt;(getWebDriver()) .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(3)) .ignoring(NoSuchElementException::class.java) val foo = wait.until {it.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;)) }     "

Driving a browser natively as a user would either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server, it marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.\nSelenium WebDriver fits in the same role as RC did, and has incorporated the original 1.x bindings. It refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver or sometimes as Selenium 2.\nSelenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0\n WebDriver is designed in a simpler and more concise programming interface along with addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API.\n WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API when compared to Selenium 1.0.\n It drives the browser much more effectively and overcomes the limitations of Selenium 1 that affected our functional test coverage, like the file upload or download, pop-ups, and dialogs barrier.\n WebDriver overcomes the limitation of Selenium RC\u0026rsquo;s single-host origin policy.\n  "

These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.\nAlerts The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as the OK button. See an example alert.\nWebDriver can get the text from the popup and accept or dismiss these alerts.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable String text = alert.getText(); //Press the OK button alert.accept();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;).click() # Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable alert = wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present()) # Store the alert text in a variable text = alert.text # Press the OK button alert.accept()   //Click the link to activate the alert driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).Click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable IAlert alert = wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.AlertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable string text = alert.Text; //Press the OK button alert.Accept();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element(:link_text, \u0026#39;See an example alert\u0026#39;).click # Store the alert reference in a variable alert = driver.switch_to.alert # Store the alert text in a variable alert_text = alert.text # Press on OK button alert.accept   //Click the link to activate the alert await driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#39;See an example alert\u0026#39;)).click(); // Wait for the alert to be displayed await driver.wait(until.alertIsPresent()); // Store the alert in a variable let alert = await driver.switchTo().alert(); //Store the alert text in a variable let alertText = await alert.getText(); //Press the OK button await alert.accept(); // Note: To use await, the above code should be inside an async function    //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).click() //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable val alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()) //Store the alert text in a variable val text = alert.getText() //Press the OK button alert.accept()     Confirm A confirm box is similar to an alert, except the user can also choose to cancel the message.

Not because it is incapable but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.\nIt may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself. Variation at these points will cause variation in your results. It is difficult to separate the difference between the performance of your website and the performance of external resources, and it is also hard to tell what the performance penalty is for using WebDriver in the browser, especially if you are injecting scripts.\nThe other potential attraction is \u0026ldquo;saving time\u0026rdquo; — carrying out functional and performance tests at the same time. However, functional and performance tests have opposing objectives. To test functionality, a tester may need to be patient and wait for loading, but this will cloud the performance testing results and vice versa.\nTo improve the performance of your website, you will need to be able to analyse overall performance independent of environment differences, identify poor code practices, breakdown of performance of individual resources (i.e. CSS or JavaScript) in order to know what to improve. There are performance testing tools available that can do this job already, and which provide reporting and analysis which can even make improvement suggestions.\nExample (open source) packages to use are: JMeter\n"

	"content": " Selenium 是一个大型软件项目，文档是了解事物如何运作和学习有效利用其潜力的关键。\nSelenium 的部分文档仍然在我们的 www.seleniumhq.org 存储库 中提供。 然而，我们正在逐步淘汰这个过分关注 Selenium RC 和其他陈旧作品的文档，以重写。\n新的文档是一个从头开始重写 Selenium 项目的文档。这是一项正在进行的工作（不针对任何特定的发行版），目的是提供一个关于如何有效使用 Selenium 的更新手册。我们希望带回来一些有意义的旧文档。\n对新文档的贡献遵循以下关于贡献的部分中描述的过程。 您应该花一些时间通过阅读 更多相关信息 来熟悉文档。\nSelenium 项目欢迎来自每个人的贡献。有很多方法可以帮助您：\n报告问题 在报告新问题或评论现有问题时，请确保讨论涉及使用 Selenium 软件或其文档的具体技术问题。\n所有 Selenium 组件随着时间的推移变化非常快，因此这可能导致文档过时。 如果您发现情况确实如此，就像上面提到的那样，不要怀疑要为此创建一个问题。 您也可能知道如何更新文档，因此请向我们发送带有相关更改的请求。\n如果您不确定您发现的是否有问题， 请先向 selenium-users@ mailing list 咨询， 或者加入我们在 irc.freenode.org 或 Slack 的 #selenium 频道。\n贡献 Selenium 项目欢迎新的贡献者。 随着时间的推移，作出重要和有价值贡献的个人成为提交者，并获得对项目的提交访问权。\n本文将指导您完成贡献流程。\nStep 1: Fork 在 Github 上 Fork 项目，并在本地检查您的副本。\n% git clone git@github.com:username/docs.git % cd docs % git remote add upstream git://github.com/seleniumhq/docs.git 依赖关系：Hugo 文档使用 Hugo 来建立和渲染网站。 要在执行任何更改之前在本地验证所有内容，请 安装 Hugo 并 运行本地服务器 以在本地呈现站点。\nStep 2: Branch 创建一个分支并开始工作：\n% git checkout -b my-feature-branch 我们实行基于 HEAD-based 的开发，这意味着所有的变更都直接应用于 master 之上。\nStep 3: Commit 首先确保 git 知道您的名字和电子邮件地址：\nFirst make sure git knows your name and email address:\n% git config --global user.name \u0026#39;Santa Claus\u0026#39; % git config --global user.email \u0026#39;santa@example.com\u0026#39; 编写好的提交消息很重要。 提交的信息应该描述改变什么，为什么要改变，和引用问题（如果有的话）。 写作时遵循以下准则：\n 第一行应该大约 50 个字符或更少，并包含对更改的简短描述。 保持第二行为空白。 72 个字符后应该换行。 包括 Fixes #N, 其中 N 是提交修复的问题编号，如果有的话。  一个好的提交消息可能如下所示：\n用一行解释规范地提交 提交消息的主体是几行文本，更详细地解释事情，可能提供有关修复问题的一些背景，等等。 提交消息的主体可以是几个段落，请进行适当的换行，并将列的长度控制在 72 个字符左右。 这样，“git log” 即使缩进也能很好地显示内容。 Fixes #141 第一行必须是有意义的，因为这是人们在运行 git shortlog 或 git log --oneline 时看到的内容。\nStep 4: Rebase 使用 git rebase （不是 git merge) 时不时地同步您的工作。\n% git fetch upstream % git rebase upstream/master Step 5: Test 始终记住运行本地服务器，有了它，您就可以安全地确保您的更改没有破坏任何东西。\nStep 6: Translations 如果您正在更新文档、添加新文档或删除不推荐的文档，请记住更新文档的翻译。 当然，您可能不会在文档中更新所有的翻译语言。 为此，请创建一个issue，清楚地描述文档中的某些内容发生了变化，需要更新其翻译。 有了这些信息，那些熟悉所需语言的人就可以帮助我们保持语言的更新。\nStep 7: Sign the CLA 在我们可以接受之前，我们首先要求人们签署贡献者许可协议 CLA。 我们这样问，是为了让我们知道贡献者有权提交代码。\n当您打开您的拉请求时，我们要求您表明您已经签署了 CLA。 这将减少我们整合它所需的时间。\nStep 8: Push % git push origin my-feature-branch 去 https://github.com/yourusername/site.git 并按下 Pull Request 并填写表单。 请注明您已签署了 CLA （见 Step 7）。\nPull requests 通常会在几天内被审查。 如果有需要处理的注释，在新的提交中应用您的更改（最好是 fixups) 并推送到同一个分支。\nStep 9: Integration 当代码审查完成后，提交者会将您的 PR 整合到文档的 gh-pages 分支上。 因为我们喜欢在主分支上保持一个线性历史，所以我们通常会压缩并重建分支历史。\nCommunication Selenium 贡献者经常在 irc.freenode.org 或 Slack 上的 #selenium 频道。 您还可以加入 selenium-developers@ mailing list。\n"

This works well for beginners, but can cause long wait times on pages that load a large number of third party resources.

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.\nTerminology  API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of \u0026ldquo;commands\u0026rdquo; you use to manipulate WebDriver. Library: A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc. Driver: Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not on the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies. Framework: An additional library used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for things such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.  The Parts and Pieces At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and receives information back via the same route.\nThe driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google\u0026rsquo;s Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may, or may not be, the same system where the tests themselves are executing.\nThis simple example above is direct communication. Communication to the browser may also be remote communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.\nRemote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system\nWhere Frameworks fit in WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about testing: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.\nThis is where various frameworks come in to play. At a minimum you\u0026rsquo;ll need a test framework that matches the language bindings, eg NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.\nThe test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.\nNatural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their own implementation.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Selenium controls web browsers Selenium is many things, but at its core it\u0026rsquo;s a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser.\nIt allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.\nAlthough used primarily for front-end testing of websites, Selenium is at its core a browser user agent library. The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application, which encourages composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.\nOne interface to rule them all One of the project\u0026rsquo;s guiding principles is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies. Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications, performing their operations in completely different ways but which frequently look the same while doing so. Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts, the images are displayed in the same place and the links take you to the same destination. What is happening underneath is as different as night and day. Selenium “abstracts” these differences, hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code. This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow, but these same lines will execute on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.\nTools and support Selenium\u0026rsquo;s minimalist design approach gives it versatility to be included as a component in bigger applications. The surrounding infrastructure provided under the Selenium umbrella gives you the tools to put together your own grid of browsers so tests can be run on different browsers and multiple operating systems across a range of machines.\nImagine a bank of computers in your server room or data centre all firing up browsers at the same time hitting your site\u0026rsquo;s links, forms, and tables\u0026mdash;testing your application 24 hours a day. Through the simple programming interface provided for the most common languages, these tests will run tirelessly in parallel, reporting back to you when errors occur.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an aim to help make this a reality for you, by providing users with tools and documentation to not only control browsers, but to make it easy to scale and deploy such grids.\nWho uses Selenium Many of the most important companies in the world have adopted Selenium for their browser-based testing, often replacing years-long efforts involving other proprietary tools. As it has grown in popularity, so have its requirements and challenges multiplied.\nAs the web becomes more complicated and new technologies are added to websites, it\u0026rsquo;s the mission of this project to keep up with them where possible. Being an open source project, this support is provided through the generous donation of time from many volunteers, every one of which has a “day job”.\nAnother mission of the project is to encourage more volunteers to partake in this effort, and build a strong community so that the project can continue to keep up with emerging technologies and remain a dominant platform for functional test automation.\nHistory When Selenium 1 was released in 2004, it was out of the necessity to reduce time spent manually verifying consistent behaviour in the front-end of a web application. It made use of what tools were available at the time, and relied heavily on the injection of JavaScript to the web page under test to emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction.\nWhilst JavaScript is a good tool to let you introspect the properties of the DOM and to do certain client-side observations that you would otherwise not be able to do, it falls short on the ability to naturally replicate a user\u0026rsquo;s interactions as if the mouse and keyboard are being used.\nSince then, Selenium has grown and matured a lot, into a tool widely used by many\u0026mdash;if not most\u0026mdash;of the largest organisations around the world. Selenium has gone from a homebrewed test automation toolkit developed at Thoughtworks for a niché audience and a specific use case, to the world\u0026rsquo;s de facto browser automation library.\nJust as Selenium RC made use of the tools of the trade available at the time, Selenium WebDriver drives that tradition on by taking the browser interaction part to the browser vendor\u0026rsquo;s home turf, and asking them to take responsibility of the backend, browser-facing implementations. Recently this work has evolved into a W3C standardisation process where the goal is to turn the WebDriver component in Selenium into the du jeur remote control library for user agents.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to test. The server can be used either from the command line or through code configuration.\nStarting the server from the command line Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar, place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from the directory with the jar, run the following:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar Considerations for running the server The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.\nThe selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session, which are cleared when Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit is called. If you forget to terminate these sessions, your server may leak memory. If you keep extremely long-running sessions, you will probably need to stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option).\nTimeouts (from version 2.21) The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60  browserTimeout  Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds).  timeout  Controls how long the client is allowed to be gone before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds).   The system property selenium.server.session.timeout is no longer supported as of 2.21.\nPlease note that the browserTimeout is intended as a backup timeout mechanism when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails, which should be used mostly in grid/server environments to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long, polluting the runtime environment.\nConfiguring the server programmatically In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the DriverServlet to a URL, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to host the page in a lightweight container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this follow.\nDownload the selenium-server.zip and unpack. Put the JARs on the CLASSPATH. Create a new class called AppServer. Here, I\u0026rsquo;m using Jetty, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download that as well:\nimport org.mortbay.jetty.Connector; import org.mortbay.jetty.Server; import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext; import javax.servlet.Servlet; import java.io.File; import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet; public class AppServer { private Server server = new Server(); public AppServer() throws Exception { WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext(); context.setContextPath(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); context.setWar(new File(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)); server.addHandler(context); context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, \u0026#34;/wd/*\u0026#34;); SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector(); connector.setPort(3001); server.addConnector(connector); server.start(); } }"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT*. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with that page of the UI. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves do not need to change; only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.\nThe Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantage: there is clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if you are using a UI map) and layout.\nPage object methods should return a value  If you submit a page and are redirected, it should return the new page object. If you click submit on login and you want to check to see if a user is logged in, it should return True or False in a method.   *AUT: Application under test\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser. Odds are good that, at some point, if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.\nFunctional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It\u0026rsquo;s a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.\nOnce you have made the determination that you\u0026rsquo;re in the web browser testing business, and you have your Selenium environment ready to begin writing tests, you will generally perform some combination of three steps:\n Set up the data Perform a discrete set of actions Evaluate the results  You will want to keep these steps as short as possible; one to two operations should be enough much of the time. Browser automation has the reputation of being “flaky”, but in reality that is because users frequently demand too much of it. In later chapters, we will return to techniques you can use to mitigate apparent intermittent problems in tests, in particular on how to overcome race conditions between the browser and WebDriver.\nBy keeping your tests short and using the web browser only when you have absolutely no alternative, you can have many tests with minimal flake.\nA distinct advantage of Selenium tests are their inherent ability to test all components of the application, from backend to frontend, from a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective. So in other words, whilst functional tests may be expensive to run, they also encompass large business-critical portions at one time.\nTesting requirements As mentioned before, Selenium tests can be expensive to run. To what extent depends on the browser you\u0026rsquo;re running the tests against, but historically browsers\u0026rsquo; behaviour has varied so much that it has often been a stated goal to cross-test against multiple browsers.\nSelenium allows you to run the same instructions against multiple browsers on multiple operating systems, but the enumeration of all the possible browsers, their different versions, and the many operating systems they run on will quickly become a non-trivial undertaking.\nLet’s start with an example Larry has written a web site which allows users to order their own custom unicorns.\nThe general workflow (what we\u0026rsquo;ll call the “happy path”) is something like this:\n Create an account Configure the unicorn Add it to the shopping cart Check out and pay Give feedback about the unicorn  It would be tempting to write one grand Selenium script to perform all these operations–many will try. Resist the temptation! Doing so will result in a test that a) takes a long time, b) will be subject to some common issues around page rendering timing issues, and c) is such that if it fails, it won\u0026rsquo;t give you a concise, “glanceable” method for diagnosing what went wrong.\nThe preferred strategy for testing this scenario would be to break it down to a series of independent, speedy tests, each of which has one “reason” to exist.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pretend you want to test the second step: Configuring your unicorn. It will perform the following actions:\n Create an account Configure a unicorn  Note that we are skipping the rest of these steps, we will test the rest of the workflow in other small, discrete test cases, after we are done with this one.\nTo start off, you need to create an account. Here you have some choices to make:\n Do you want to use an existing account? Do you want to create a new account? Are there any special properties of such a user that need to be taken into account before configuration begins?  Regardless of how you answer this question, the solution is to make it part of the \u0026ldquo;set up the data\u0026rdquo; portion of the test– if Larry has exposed an API which enables you (or anyone) to create and update user accounts, be sure to use that to answer this question– if possible, you want to launch the browser only after you have a user \u0026ldquo;in hand\u0026rdquo;, whose credentials you can just log in with.\nIf each test for each workflow begins with the creation of a user account, many seconds will be added to the execution of each test. Calling an API and talking to a database are quick, “headless” operations that don\u0026rsquo;t require the expensive process of opening a browser, navigating to the right pages, clicking and waiting for the forms to be submitted, etc.\nIdeally, you can address this set-up phase in one line of code, which will execute before any browser is launched:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. User user = UserFactory.createCommonUser(); //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. AccountPage accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());   # Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, # but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have # administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email # address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to # know them. user = user_factory.create_common_user() #This method is defined elsewhere. # Log in as this user. # Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the # AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then # perform actions from the AccountPage. account_page = login_as(user.get_email(), user.get_password())   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. val user = UserFactory.createCommonUser() //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. val accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword())     As you can imagine, the UserFactory can be extended to provide methods such as createAdminUser(), and createUserWithPayment(). The point is, these two lines of code do not distract you from the ultimate purpose of this test: configuring a unicorn.\nThe intricacies of the Page Object model will be discussed in later chapters, but we will introduce the concept here:\nYour tests should be composed of actions, performed from the user\u0026rsquo;s point of view, within the context of pages in the site. These pages are stored as objects, which will contain specific information about how the web page is composed and how actions are performed– very little of which should concern you as a tester.\nWhat kind of unicorn do you want? You might want pink, but not necessarily. Purple has been quite popular lately. Does she need sunglasses? Star tattoos? These choices, while difficult, are your primary concern as a tester– you need to ensure that your order fulfillment center sends out the right unicorn to the right person, and that starts with these choices.\nNotice that nowhere in that paragraph do we talk about buttons, fields, drop-downs, radio buttons, or web forms. Neither should your tests! You want to write your code like the user trying to solve their problem. Here is one way of doing this (continuing from the previous example):\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. // This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact // with the browser in any way. Unicorn sparkles = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS); // Since we\u0026#39;re already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the // actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method // takes us there. AddUnicornPage addUnicornPage = accountPage.addUnicorn(); // Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to // its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, // fill out the form, and click submit.

This method of modelling the application allows you to keep these test-level commands in place and unchanging, even if Larry decides next week that he no longer likes Ruby-on-Rails and decides to re-implement the entire site in the latest Haskell bindings with a Fortran front-end.\nYour page objects will require some small maintenance in order to conform to the site redesign, but these tests will remain the same. Taking this basic design, you will want to keep going through your workflows with the fewest browser-facing steps possible. Your next workflow will involve adding a unicorn to the shopping cart. You will probably want many iterations of this test in order to make sure the cart is keeping its state properly: Is there more than one unicorn in the cart before you start? How many can fit in the shopping cart? If you create more than one with the same name and/or features, will it break? Will it only keep the existing one or will it add another?\nEach time you move through the workflow, you want to try to avoid having to create an account, login as the user, and configure the unicorn. Ideally, you will be able to create an account and pre-configure a unicorn via the API or database. Then all you have to do is log in as the user, locate Sparkles, and add her to the cart.\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.\nYour users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty; they want to book travel to Alaska; they want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you are working on, such that the test scripts (the user\u0026rsquo;s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for, and represent the user.\nWith Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).\nBenefits  Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it. Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication. Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality. Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT*.  Java Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.\n/** * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;. * @return An instance of the AccountPage */ public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) { WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;loginField\u0026#34;)); loginField.clear(); loginField.sendKeys(username); // Fill out the password field. The locator we\u0026#39;re using is \u0026#34;By.id\u0026#34;, and we should  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;)); passwordField.clear(); passwordField.sendKeys(password); // Click the login button, which happens to have the id \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;.  driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;)).click(); // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium  // PageFactory).  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class); } This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all a tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.\npublic void loginTest() { loginAsUser(\u0026#34;cbrown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cl0wn3\u0026#34;); // Now that we\u0026#39;re logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support  // our testers, it\u0026#39;s as easy as choosing from available methods.  do.something(); do.somethingElse(); Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Something should have been done!\u0026#34;, something.wasDone()); // Note that we still haven\u0026#39;t referred to a button or web control anywhere in this  // script... } It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they do not care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.\n*AUT: Application under test\n"

All remote Webdriver capabilities are sent through JsonWireProtocol. For a list of configurable capabilities, and more information on JsonWireProtocol, please visit the documentation here.\nFor example, suppose you wanted to run Chrome on Windows XP, using Chrome version 67:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome caps.platform = Windows XP caps.version = 67 driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, :desired_capabilities =\u0026gt; caps   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val chromeOptions = ChromeOptions() chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); val driver: WebDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;) driver.quit();     Local file detector The Local File Detector allows the transfer of files from the client machine to the remote server. For example, if a test needs to upload a file to a web application, a remote WebDriver can automatically transfer the file from the local machine to the remote web server during runtime. This allows the file to be uploaded from the remote machine running the test. It is not enabled by default and can be enabled in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.file_detector = lambda do |args| # args =\u0026gt; [\u0026#34;/path/to/file\u0026#34;] str = args.first.to_s str if File.exist?(str) end   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector())     Once the above code is defined, you can upload a file in your test in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;); WebElement upload = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)); upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.navigate.to \u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34; element = @driver.find_element(:id, \u0026#39;myfile\u0026#39;) element.send_keys \u0026#34;/Users/sso/SauceLabs/sauce/hostess/maitred/maitred/public/images/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;) val upload: WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)) upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;)     "

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.\nWebDriver\u0026rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers. For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies, please see Driver Idiosyncracies.\nEven though all the drivers share a single user-facing interface for controlling the browser, they have slightly different ways of setting up browser sessions. Since many of the driver implementations are provided by third parties, they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution.\nDriver instantiation, profile management, and various browser specific settings are examples of parameters that have different requirements depending on the browser. This section explains the basic requirements for getting you started with the different browsers.\nAdding Executables to your PATH Most drivers require an extra executable for Selenium to communicate with the browser. You can manually specify where the executable lives before starting WebDriver, but this can make your tests less portable, as the executables will need to be in the same place on every machine, or included within your test code repository.\nBy adding a folder containing WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s binaries to your system\u0026rsquo;s path, Selenium will be able to locate the additional binaries without requiring your test code to locate the exact location of the driver.\n Create a directory to place the executables in, like C:\\WebDriver\\bin or /opt/WebDriver/bin Add the directory to your PATH:\n On Windows - Open a command prompt as administrator and the run the following command to permanently add the directory to your path for all users on your machine:\nsetx /m path \u0026#34;%path%;C:\\WebDriver\\bin\\\u0026#34; Bash users on macOS and Linux - In a terminal:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/WebDriver/bin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile  You are now ready to test your changes. Close all open command prompts and open a new one. Type out the name of one of the binaries in the folder you created in the previous step, e.g:\nchromedriver If your PATH is configured correctly, you will see some some output relating to the startup of the driver:\nStarting ChromeDriver 2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1) on port 9515 Only local connections are allowed.  You can regain control of your command prompt by pressing Ctrl + C\nQuick reference    Browser Supported OS Maintained by Download Issue Tracker     Chromium/Chrome Windows/macOS/Linux Google Downloads Issues   Firefox Windows/macOS/Linux Mozilla Downloads Issues   Edge Windows 10 Microsoft Downloads Issues   Internet Explorer Windows Selenium Project Downloads Issues   Safari macOS El Capitan and newer Apple Built in Issues   Opera Windows/macOS/Linux Opera Downloads Issues    Chromium/Chrome To drive Chrome or Chromium, you have to download chromedriver and put it in a folder that is on your system\u0026rsquo;s path.\nOn Linux or macOS, this means modifying the PATH environmental variable. You can see what directories, separated by a colon, make up your system\u0026rsquo;s path by executing the following command:\n$ echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin To include chromedriver on the path if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already, make sure you include the chromedriver binary\u0026rsquo;s parent directory. The following line will set the PATH environmental variable its current content, plus an additional path added after the colon:\n$ export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34; When chromedriver is available on your path, you should be able to execute the chromedriver executable from any directory.\nTo instantiate a Chrome/Chromium session, you can do the following:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Chrome driver = Chrome() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Chrome with Chrome() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); const chrome = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver/chrome\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;chrome\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver val driver: WebDriver = ChromeDriver()     Remember that you have to set the path to the chromedriver executable. This is possible using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Chrome(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;)   new ChromeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;   chrome.setDefaultService(new chrome.ServiceBuilder(\u0026#39;path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;).build());   System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;)     The chromedriver is implemented as a WebDriver remote server that by exposing Chrome\u0026rsquo;s internal automation proxy interface instructs the browser what to do.\nFirefox Starting with Selenium 3, Mozilla has taken over implementation of Firefox Driver, with geckodriver. The new driver for Firefox is called geckodriver and works with Firefox 48 and newer. Since the Firefox WebDriver is under development, the newer the Firefox version the better the support.\nAs geckodriver is the new default way of launching Firefox, you can instantiate Firefox in the same way as Selenium 2:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver; WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Firefox driver = Firefox() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Firefox with Firefox() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;firefox\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver val driver: WebDriver = FirefoxDriver()     If you prefer not to set geckodriver\u0026rsquo;s location using PATH, set the geckodriver binary location programmatically:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Firefox(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#39;)   new FirefoxDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;)     It is also possible to set the property at run time:\nmvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver It is currently possible to revert to the older, more feature complete Firefox driver, by installing Firefox 47.0.1 or 45 ESR and specifying a desired capability of marionette as false. Later releases of Firefox are no longer compatible.\nEdge Edge is Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s newest browser, included with Windows 10 and Server 2016. Updates to Edge are bundled with major Windows updates, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download a binary which matches the build number of your currently installed build of Windows. The Edge Developer site contains links to all the available binaries. Bugs against the EdgeDriver implementation can be raised with Microsoft. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to run tests against Edge, but aren\u0026rsquo;t running Windows 10, Microsoft offer free VMs for testers on the Edge Developer site.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver; WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Edge driver = Edge() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Edge with Edge() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Edge; IWebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :edge   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;MicrosoftEdge\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver val driver: WebDriver = EdgeDriver()     If Edge driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Edge(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#39;)   new EdgeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Edge.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Internet Explorer Internet Explorer was Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s default browser until Windows 10, although it is still included in Windows 10. Internet Explorer Driver is the only driver The Selenium project aims to support the same releases Microsoft considers current. Older releases may work, but will be unsupported.\nWhile the Selenium project provides binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer, there are some limitations with Internet Explorer 10 \u0026amp; 11 with the 64-bit driver, but using the 32-bit driver continues to work well. It should be noted that as Internet Explorer preferences are saved against the logged in user\u0026rsquo;s account, some additional setup is required.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver; WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Ie driver = Ie() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Ie with Ie() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.IE; IWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :internet_explorer   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;internet explorer\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver val driver: WebDriver = InternetExplorerDriver()     If Internet Explorer driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Ie(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe\u0026#39;)   new InternetExplorerDriver(\u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::IE.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/IEDriver.exe\u0026#34;)     Microsoft also offer a WebDriver binary for Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 \u0026amp; 8.1. It has not been updated since 2014 and is based of a draft version of the W3 specification. Jim Evans has an excellent writeup on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s implementation.\nOpera Current releases of Opera are built on top of the Chromium engine, and WebDriver is now supported via the closed-source Opera Chromium Driver, which can be added to your PATH or as a system property.\nInstantiating a driver session is similar to Firefox and Chromium:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver; WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Opera driver = Opera() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Opera with Opera() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Opera; IWebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver val driver: WebDriver = OperaDriver()     Safari Starting with Safari 10 on macOS El Capitan and Sierra, WebDriver support is included with each release of the browser. To enable support:\n Enable the Developer menu from Safari preferences Check the Allow Remote Automation option from with the Develop menu Run the following command from the terminal for the first time and type your password at the prompt to authorise WebDriver\n/usr/bin/safaridriver -p 1337\u0026lt;/  You can then start a driver session using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver; WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Safari driver = Safari() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Safari with Safari() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Safari; IWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :safari   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;safari\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();   import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver val driver: WebDriver = SafariDriver()     Those looking to automate Safari on iOS should look to the Appium project. Whilst Safari was previously available for Windows, Apple has long since dropped support, making it a poor choice of test platform.\nMock browsers HtmlUnit HtmlUnit is a \u0026ldquo;GUI-Less browser for Java programs\u0026rdquo;. It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc. It has JavaScript support and is able to work with AJAX libraries, simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used. It has been moved to a new location. The source is maintained on svn.\nPhantomJS PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, albeit a version much older than that used by Google Chrome or Safari. Whilst historically a popular choice, it would now be wise to avoid PhantomJS. The project has been unmaintained since the 5th of August, so whilst the web will continue to change, PhantomJS will not be updated. This was after Google announced the ability to run Chrome headlessly, something also now offered by Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n You will occasionally want to validate the colour of something as part of your tests; the problem is that colour definitions on the web are not constant. Would it not be nice if there was an easy way to compare a HEX representation of a colour with a RGB representation of a colour, or a RGBA representation of a colour with a HSLA representation of a colour?\nWorry not. There is a solution: the Color class!\nFirst of all, you will need to import the class:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color;   from selenium.webdriver.support.color import Color   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color    You can now start creating colour objects.

Supported colour representations are:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color HEX_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;#2F7ED8\u0026#34;); private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#34;); private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#34;); private final Color HSL_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#34;); private final Color HSLA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#34;);   HEX_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;#2F7ED8\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#39;) HSL_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#39;) HSLA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    HEX_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;#2F7ED8\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#39;) RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#39;) RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#39;) HSL_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#39;) HSLA_COLOUR = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val HEX_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;#2F7ED8\u0026#34;) private val RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026#34;) private val RGB_COLOUR_PERCENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)\u0026#34;) private val RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)\u0026#34;) private val RGBA_COLOUR_PERCENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)\u0026#34;) private val HSL_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsl(100, 0%, 50%)\u0026#34;) private val HSLA_COLOUR = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)\u0026#34;)     The Color class also supports all of the base colour definitions specified in http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#html4.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color BLACK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;black\u0026#34;); private final Color CHOCOLATE = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;chocolate\u0026#34;); private final Color HOTPINK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hotpink\u0026#34;);   BLACK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) CHOCOLATE = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;chocolate\u0026#39;) HOTPINK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hotpink\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    BLACK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) CHOCOLATE = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;chocolate\u0026#39;) HOTPINK = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;hotpink\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val BLACK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;black\u0026#34;) private val CHOCOLATE = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;chocolate\u0026#34;) private val HOTPINK = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;hotpink\u0026#34;)     Sometimes browsers will return a colour value of \u0026ldquo;transparent\u0026rdquo; if no colour has been set on an element. The Color class also supports this:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin private final Color TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;);   TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string(\u0026#39;transparent\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    private val TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString(\u0026#34;transparent\u0026#34;)     You can now safely query an element to get its colour/background colour knowing that any response will be correctly parsed and converted into a valid Color object:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin Color loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;); Color loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;);   login_button_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).value_of_css_property(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    login_button_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;color\u0026#39;) login_button_background_colour = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;login\u0026#39;).css_value(\u0026#39;background-color\u0026#39;);   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;color\u0026#34;) val loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;)).getCssValue(\u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34;)     You can then directly compare colour objects:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK);   assert login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK))     Or you can convert the colour into one of the following formats and perform a static validation:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;); assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;);   assert login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39; assert login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(login_button_background_colour.hex == \u0026#39;#ff69b4\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgba == \u0026#39;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#39;) assert(login_button_background_colour.rgb == \u0026#39;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#39;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals(\u0026#34;#ff69b4\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals(\u0026#34;rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)\u0026#34;)) assert(loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals(\u0026#34;rgb(255, 105, 180)\u0026#34;))     Colours are no longer a problem.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n For some browser configurations in Selenium RC, Selenium acted as a proxy between the browser and the site being automated. This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.\nSelenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user and this is represented in the way you write tests with WebDriver. In automated functional testing, checking the status code is not a particularly important detail of a test\u0026rsquo;s failure; the steps that preceded it are more important.\nThe browser will always represent the HTTP status code, imagine for example a 404 or a 500 error page. A simple way to “fail fast” when you encounter one of these error pages is to check the page title or content of a reliable point (e.g. the \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag) after every page load. If you are using the page object model, you can include this check in your class constructor or similar point where the page load is expected. Occasionally, the HTTP code may even be represented in the browser\u0026rsquo;s error page and you could use WebDriver to read this and improve your debugging output.\nChecking the webpage itself is in line with WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s ideal practice of representing and asserting upon the user’s view of the website.\nIf you insist, an advanced solution to capturing HTTP status codes is to replicate the behaviour of Selenium RC by using a proxy. WebDriver API provides the ability to set a proxy for the browser, and there are a number of proxies that will programmatically allow you to manipulate the contents of requests sent to and received from the web server. Using a proxy lets you decide how you want to respond to redirection response codes. Additionally, not every browser makes the response codes available to WebDriver, so opting to use a proxy allows you to have a solution that works for every browser.\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Localiser des éléments Une des techniques fondamentales à maîtriser lorsque l\u0026rsquo;on utilise WebDriver consiste à chercher des éléments sur une page. WebDriver offre pour cela un ensemble pré-défini de type de selecteurs, parmi lesquels la recherche d\u0026rsquo;une élément par son attribut ID:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)   IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)   const fromage = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;fromage\u0026#39;));   val cheese: WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;))     Comme démontré dans cet exemple, la localisation des éléments à l\u0026rsquo;aide de WebDriver se fait via une instance de l\u0026rsquo;objet WebDriver. La méthode findElement(By) retourne un autre type d\u0026rsquo;objet fondamental, un WebElement.\n WebDriver represente la navigateur WebElement represente un noeud particulier du DOM (un lien, un champ texte, etc.)  Un fois que l\u0026rsquo;on a obtenu la référence de l\u0026rsquo;élément web qui a été \u0026ldquo;trouvé\u0026rdquo;, on peut encore réduire la portée de notre recherche en utilisant le même appel de méthode sur l\u0026rsquo;instance de cet objet:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement fromage = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)); WebElement cheddar = fromage.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   fromage = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;) cheddar = fromage.find_elements_by_id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   IWebElement fromage = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;)); IWebElement cheddar = fromage.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   fromage = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;fromage\u0026#34;) cheddar = fromage.find_elements(id: \u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   const fromage = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;fromage\u0026#39;)); const cheddar = await fromage.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheddar\u0026#39;));   val cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)) val cheddar = cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;))     Nous pouvons faire cela car les types WebDriver et WebElement implémentent tous deux l\u0026rsquo;interface SearchContext. Dans WebDriver, ce principe est connu sous le nom de role-based interface. Les interfaces basées sur le rôle nous permettent de déterminer si une implémentation particulière de driver supporte une fonctionnalité donnée. Ces interfaces sont clairement définies et tente d\u0026rsquo;adhérer au principe de responsabilité unique. Vous pouvez en lire plus sur le design de WebDriver et sur quels drivers supportent quels rôles dans le chapitre Un Autre Chapitre Qui Aura Un Nom. Par conséquent, l\u0026rsquo;interface By utilisée précédement fournit également d\u0026rsquo;autres stratégies de localisation. Une recherche imbriquée peut ne pas être la startégie la plus adaptée pour trouver notre cheddar puisqu\u0026rsquo;elle nécessite que deux instructions séparées soient envoyées au navigateur ; tout d\u0026rsquo;abord rechercher un élément ayant pour ID \u0026ldquo;fromage\u0026rdquo;, puis une recherche pour \u0026ldquo;cheddar\u0026rdquo; dans ce contexte plus restreint.\nPour améliorer légèrement les performances, nous pourrions essayer un sélecteur (une stratégie de localisation) plus spécifique : WebDriver supporte la localisation d\u0026rsquo;élément via sélecteur CSS, nous permettant de combiner les deux sélecteurs précédents en un seul:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheddar = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;)   driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheddar = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#fromage #cheddar\u0026#39;));   driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;))     Localiser plusieurs éléments Il est possible que le document web sur lequel nous travaillons dispose d\u0026rsquo;une liste ordonnée de nos fromages préférés:\n\u0026lt;ol id=fromage\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li id=cheddar\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=brie\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=rochefort\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=camembert\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; Puisque plus de fromage est sans conteste meilleur, et qu\u0026rsquo;il serait lourd de devoir récupérer chaque item un par un, une technique supérieure est d\u0026rsquo;utiliser la forme plurielle findElements(By). Cette méthode retourne une collection d\u0026rsquo;éléments web. Si un seul élement a été trouvé, la méthode renverra tout de même une collection (d\u0026rsquo;un seul élément). Si aucun élément ne correspond au sélécteur, la collection retournée sera alors vide.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; pleinDeFromage = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;));   plein_de_fromage = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;)   IReadOnlyList\u0026lt;IWebElement\u0026gt; pleinDeFromage = driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(“#fromage li”));   plein_de_fromage = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#fromage li\u0026#34;)   const pleinDeFromage = await driver.findElements(By.css(\u0026#39;#fromage li\u0026#39;));   val muchoCheese: List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;))     Stratégie de sélection des éléments WebDriver possède huit stratégies de localisation pré-définies différentes:\n   Sélecteur Description     class name Localise les éléments dont le nom de la classe contient la valeur recherchée (nom composés non permis)   css selector Localise les éléments correspondant à un sélecteur CSS   id Localise les éléments dont l\u0026rsquo;attribut ID correspond à la valeur recherchée   name Localise les éléments dont l\u0026rsquo;attribut NAME correspond à la valeur recherchée   link text Localise les éléments de type ancre (lien) dont le texte visible correspond à la valeur recherchée   partial link text Localise les éléments de type ancre (lien) dont le texte visible contient la valeur recherchée   tag name Localise les éléments dont le nom de tag correspond à la valeur recherchée   xpath Localise les éléments correspondant à un chemin XPath    Astuces d\u0026rsquo;utilisation des sélecteurs En règle général, si des ID HTML sont disponibles, uniques et prédictibles avec constance, alors il est préférable d\u0026rsquo;utiliser cette stratégie pour la localisation d\u0026rsquo;élément sur une page. Elle a tendance à être très rapide et évite les longs traitements liés à des traversées complexes du DOM.\nSi des IDs uniques ne sont pas disponibles, un sélecteur CSS bien écrit est la méthode de localisation la plus adaptée. Un sélecteur XPath marchera aussi bien qu\u0026rsquo;un sélecteur CSS, cependant sa syntaxe est plus complexe, et souvent, plus compliquée à débugguer. Même si les sélecteur XPath sont très flexibles, ils sont rarement testés d\u0026rsquo;un point de vue performance par les fournisseurs de navigateur et ont donc tendance à être assez lents.\nLes stratégies basés sur link text et partial link text sont contraingnantes du fait qu\u0026rsquo;elles ne fonctionnent que sur des éléments de type lien hypertexte. De plus, elles sont implémentées au sein de WebDriver via des sélecteurs XPath.\nLe nom de tag est une façon dangereuse de localiser des éléments. Il y a fréquemment de multiples éléments ayant le même tag sur une page. Cette stratégie est principalement utile lorsque utilisée avec la méthode findElements(By), renvoyant une collection des élements.\nAu final, la recommendation est de garder ses sélecteurs aussi compacts et lisibles que possible. Demander à WebDriver de traverser la structure du DOM est une opération très coûteuse, de fait plus le scope de recherche sera restreint, meilleures seront les performances.\n"

To find out which directories are in PATH, type echo %PATH% in command prompt.\n$ echo %PATH% C:\\Ruby200\\bin;C:\\WINDOWS\\system32;C:\\WINDOWS;C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\Wbem C:\\Ruby200\\bin looks like a good place. Unzip IEDriverServer file and move IEDriverServer.exe there.\nThis should open a new Internet Explorer window:\nrequire \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :internet_explorer Browser navigation Navigate to The first thing you will want to do after launching a browser is to open your website. This can be achieved in a single line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Convenient driver.get(\u0026#34;https://www.seleniumhq.org\u0026#34;); //Longer way driver.navigate().to(\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/\u0026#34;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;https://www.seleniumhq.org\u0026#34;)   driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(@\u0026#34;http://google.com\u0026#34;);   # Convenient way driver.get \u0026#39;https://www.seleniumhq.org\u0026#39; # Longer Way driver.navigate.to \u0026#39;https://www.seleniumhq.org\u0026#39;   await driver.get(\u0026#39;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/\u0026#39;);   //Convenient driver.get(\u0026#34;https://www.seleniumhq.org\u0026#34;) //Longer way driver.navigate().to(\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/\u0026#34;)     Get current URL You can read the current URL from the browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.getCurrentUrl();  driver.current_url  driver.Url;   driver.current_url  await driver.getCurrentUrl();   driver.getCurrentUrl();    Back Pressing the browser\u0026rsquo;s back button:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.navigate().back();  driver.back()  driver.Navigate().Back();   driver.navigate.back  await driver.navigate().back();   driver.navigate().back()     Forward Pressing the browser\u0026rsquo;s forward button:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.navigate().forward();  driver.forward()  driver.Navigate().Forward();   driver.navigate.forward  await driver.navigate().forward();   driver.navigate().forward();    Refresh Refresh the current page:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.navigate().refresh();  driver.refresh()  driver.Navigate().Refresh();   driver.navigate.refresh  await driver.navigate().refresh();   driver.navigate().refresh()    Get title You can read the current page title from the browser:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.getTitle();  driver.title  driver.Title;   driver.title  await driver.getTitle();   driver.getTitle()    Windows and tabs WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the distinction between windows and tabs. If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.getWindowHandle();  driver.current_window_handle  driver.CurrentWindowHandle;   driver.window_handle  await driver.getWindowHandle();   driver.getWindowHandle()    Switching windows or tabs Clicking a link which opens in a new window will focus the new window or tab on screen, but WebDriver will not know which window the Operating System considers active. To work with the new window you will need to switch to it. If you have only two tabs or windows open, and you know which window you start with, by the process of elimination you can loop over both windows or tabs that WebDriver can see, and switch to the one which is not the original.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Store the ID of the original window String originalWindow = driver.getWindowHandle(); //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert driver.getWindowHandles().size() == 1; //Click the link which opens in a new window driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;)).click();

Assuming you followed the code sample in the previous section you will have the previous window handle stored in a variable. Put this together and you will get:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Close the tab or window driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close() #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window(original_window)   //Close the tab or window driver.Close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.SwitchTo().Window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window original_window   //Close the tab or window await driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window await driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   //Close the tab or window driver.close() //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow)     Forgetting to switch back to another window handle after closing a window will leave WebDriver executing on the now closed page, and will trigger a No Such Window Exception. You must switch back to a valid window handle in order to continue execution.\nQuitting the browser at the end of a session When you are finished with the browser session you should call quit, instead of close:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.quit();  driver.quit()  driver.Quit();   driver.quit  await driver.quit();   driver.quit()     Quit will:  Close all the windows and tabs associated with that WebDriver session The browser process The background driver process Notify Selenium Grid that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session (if you are using Selenium Grid)   Failure to call quit will leave extra background processes and ports running on your machine which could cause you problems later.\nSome test frameworks offer methods and annotations which you can hook into to tear down at the end of a test.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll public static void tearDown() { driver.quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /* Example using Visual Studio\u0026#39;s UnitTesting https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.aspx */ [TestCleanup] public void TearDown() { driver.Quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /** * Example using Mocha * https://mochajs.org/#hooks */ after(\u0026#39;Tear down\u0026#39;, async function () { await driver.quit(); });   /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll fun tearDown() { driver.quit() }     If not running WebDriver in a test context, you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit(); }   try: #WebDriver code here... finally: driver.quit()   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.Quit(); }   begin #WebDriver code here... ensure driver.quit end   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { await driver.quit(); }   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit() }     Python\u0026rsquo;s WebDriver now supports the python context manager, which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution.\nwith webdriver.Firefox() as driver: # WebDriver code here... # WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation Frames and Iframes Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain. You are unlikely to work with them unless you are working with an pre HTML5 webapp. Iframes allow the insertion of a document from an entirely different domain, and are still commonly used.\nIf you need to work with frames or iframes, Webdriver allows you to work with them in the same way. Consider a button within an iframe. If we inspect the element using the browser development tools, we might see the following:\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;modal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe id=\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/iframe.html\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Click here\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the iframe we would expect to click on the button using something like:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # This Wont work driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # This won\u0026#39;t work driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // This won\u0026#39;t work await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     However, if there are no buttons outside of the iframe, you might instead get a no such element error. This happens because Selenium is only aware of the elements in the top level document. To interact with the button, we will need to first switch to the frame, in a similar way to how we switch windows. WebDriver offers three ways of switching to a frame.\nUsing a WebElement Switching using a WebElement is the most flexible option. You can find the frame using your preferred selector and switch to it.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Store the web element WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # Store iframe web element iframe = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#34;) # switch to selected iframe driver.switch_to.frame(iframe) # Now click on button driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //Store the web element IWebElement iframe = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # Store iframe web element iframe = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#39;) # Switch to the frame driver.switch_to.frame iframe # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // Store the web element const iframe = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#39;)); // Switch to the frame await driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //Store the web element WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)) //Switch to the frame driver.switchTo().frame(iframe) //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     Using a name or ID If your frame or iframe has an id or name attribute, this can be used instead. If the name or ID is not unique on the page, then the first one found will be switched to.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Using the ID driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # Switch frame by id driver.switch_to.frame(\u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39;) # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click()   //Using the ID driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # Switch by ID driver.switch_to.frame \u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39; # Now, Click on the button driver.find_element(:tag_name,\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;).click   // Using the ID await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39;); // Or using the name instead await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;myframe\u0026#39;); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();   //Using the ID driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;) //Or using the name instead driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;) //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click()     Using an index It is also possible to use the index of the frame, such as can be queried using window.frames in JavaScript.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Switches to the second frame driver.switchTo().frame(1);   # Switch to the second frame driver.switch_to.frame(1)   // Switches to the second frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(1);   # switching to second iframe based on index iframe = driver.find_elements_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;)[1] # switch to selected iframe driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)   // Switches to the second frame await driver.switchTo().frame(1);   // Switches to the second frame driver.switchTo().frame(1)     Leaving a frame To leave an iframe or frameset, switch back to the default content like so:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return to the top level driver.switchTo().defaultContent();   # switch back to default content driver.switch_to.default_content()   // Return to the top level driver.SwitchTo().DefaultContent();   # Return to the top level driver.switch_to.default_content   // Return to the top level await driver.switchTo().defaultContent();   // Return to the top level driver.switchTo().defaultContent()     Window management Screen resolution can impact how your web application renders, so WebDriver provides mechanisms for moving and resizing the browser window.\nGet window size Fetches the size of the browser window in pixels.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.manage().window().getSize().getWidth(); int height = driver.manage().window().getSize().getHeight(); //Or store the dimensions and query them later Dimension size = driver.manage().window().getSize(); int width1 = size.getWidth(); int height1 = size.getHeight();   # Access each dimension individually width = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;) # Or store the dimensions and query them later size = driver.get_window_size() width1 = size.get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height1 = size.get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;)   //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Width; int height = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Height; //Or store the dimensions and query them later System.Drawing.Size size = driver.Manage().Window.Size; int width1 = size.Width; int height1 = size.Height;   # Access each dimension individually width = driver.manage.window.size.width height = driver.manage.window.size.height # Or store the dimensions and query them later size = driver.manage.window.size width1 = size.width height1 = size.height   // Access each dimension individually const { width, height } = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later const rect = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); const width1 = rect.width; const height1 = rect.height;   //Access each dimension individually val width = driver.manage().window().getSize().getWidth() val height = driver.manage().window().getSize().getHeight() //Or store the dimensions and query them later val size = driver.manage().window().getSize() val width1 = size.getWidth() val height1 = size.getHeight()     Set window size Restores the window and sets the window size. Java Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1024, 768));  driver.set_window_size(1024, 768)  driver.Manage().Window.Size = new Size(1024, 768);   driver.manage.window.resize_to(1024,768)  await driver.manage().window().setRect({ width: 1024, height: 768 });   driver.manage().window().size(Dimension(1024, 768))   \nGet window position Fetches the coordinates of the top left coordinate of the browser window.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Access each dimension individually int x = driver.manage().window().getPosition().getX(); int y = driver.manage().window().getPosition().getY(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later Point position = driver.manage().window().getPosition(); int x1 = position.getX(); int y1 = position.getY();   # Access each dimension individually x = driver.get_window_position().get(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;) y = driver.get_window_position().get(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) # Or store the dimensions and query them later position = driver.get_window_position() x1 = position.get(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;) y1 = position.get(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;)   //Access each dimension individually int x = driver.Manage().Window.Position.X; int y = driver.Manage().Window.Position.Y; //Or store the dimensions and query them later Point position = driver.Manage().Window.Position; int x1 = position.X; int y1 = position.Y;   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Access each dimension individually const { x, y } = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later const rect = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); const x1 = rect.x; const y1 = rect.y;   // Access each dimension individually val x = driver.manage().window().position.x val y = driver.manage().window().position.y // Or store the dimensions and query them later val position = driver.manage().window().position val x1 = position.x int y1 = position.y     Set window position Moves the window to the chosen position.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.manage().window().setPosition(new Point(0, 0));   # Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.set_window_position(0, 0)   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.Manage().Window.Position = new Point(0, 0);   driver.manage.window.move_to(0,0)   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor await driver.manage().window().setRect({ x: 0, y: 0 });   // Move the window to the top left of the primary monitor driver.manage().window().position = Point(0,0)     Maximise window Enlarges the window.

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n To use Selenium Grid, you need to maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes. As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort, many organizations use IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute to provide this infrastructure.\nOther options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud. It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware. This chapter will go into detail about the option of running your own grid, complete with its own node infrastructure.\nQuick start This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Grid Hub, and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node. We will also show you how to call the grid from Java. The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine, but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.\nThe selenium-server-standalone package includes the hub, WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the Grid, ant is not required anymore. You can download the selenium-server-standalone-.jar from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.\nStep 1: Start the Hub The Hub is the central point that will receive test requests and distribute them to the right nodes. The distribution is done on a capabilities basis, meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.\nBecause a test\u0026rsquo;s desired capabilities are just what the name implies, desired, the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone.jar file. You start the hub by passing the -role hub flag to the standalone server:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub The Hub will listen to port 4444 by default. You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to http://localhost:4444/grid/console.\nTo change the default port, you can add the optional -port flag with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command. Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below) are possible command-line flags.\nYou certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above, but if you need more advanced configuration, you can also specify a JSON format config file, for convenience, to configure the hub when you start it. You can do it like so:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug Below you will see an example of a hubConfig.json file. We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.\n{ \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;cleanupCycle\u0026#34;: 5000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 300000, \u0026#34;newSessionWaitTimeout\u0026#34;: -1, \u0026#34;servlets\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;prioritizer\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;capabilityMatcher\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;throwOnCapabilityNotPresent\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;nodePolling\u0026#34;: 180000, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;} Step 2: Start the Nodes Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality, or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality, or both at the same time, you use the same selenium-server-standalone.jar file to start the nodes:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444 If a port is not specified through the -port flag, a free port will be chosen. You can run multiple nodes on one machine but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory resources and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.\nConfiguration of Node with options As mentioned, for backwards compatibility “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role. But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.\nPassing JVM properties (using the -D flag before the -jar argument) on the command line as well, and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:\n-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe\nConfiguration of Node with JSON You can also start grid nodes that are configured with a JSON configuration file\njava -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json And here is an example of a nodeConfig.json file:\n{ \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;acceptSslCerts\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;javascriptEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;takesScreenshot\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;firefox_profile\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;browser-version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;firefox_binary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanSession\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chrome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;internet explorer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanUpCycle\u0026#34;: 2000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 30000, \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 5555, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;register\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;hubPort\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5 } } A note about the -host flag\nFor both hub and node, if the -host flag is not specified, 0.0.0.0 will be used by default. This will bind to all the public (non-loopback) IPv4 interfaces of the machine. If you have a special network configuration or any component that creates extra network interfaces, it is advised to set the -host flag with a value that allows the hub/node to be reachable from a different machine.\nSpecifying the port The default TCP/IP port used by the hub is 4444. If you need to change the port please use above mentioned configurations.\nTroubleshooting Using Log file For advanced troubleshooting you can specify a log file to log system messages. Start Selenium GRID hub or node with -log argument. Please see the below example:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -log log.txt Use your favorite text editor to open log file (log.txt in the example above) to find \u0026ldquo;ERROR\u0026rdquo; logs if you get issues.\nUsing -debug argument Also you can use -debug argument to print debug logs to console. Start Selenium Grid Hub or Node with -debug argument. Please see the below example:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -debug Warning The Selenium Grid must be protected from external access using appropriate firewall permissions.\nFailure to protect your Grid could result in one or more of the following occurring:\n You provide open access to your Grid infrastructure You allow third parties to access internal web applications and files You allow third parties to run custom binaries  See this blog post on Detectify, which gives a good overview of how a publicly exposed Grid could be misused: Don\u0026rsquo;t Leave your Grid Wide Open.\nDocker Selenium Docker provides a convenient way to provision and scale Selenium Grid infrastructure in a unit known as a container. Containers are standardised units of software that contain everything required to run the desired application, including all dependencies, in a reliable and repeatable way on different machines.\nThe Selenium project maintains a set of Docker images which you can download and run to get a working grid up and running quickly. Nodes are available for both Firefox and Chrome. Full details of how to provision a grid can be found within the Docker Selenium repository.\nPrerequisite The only requirement to run a Grid is to have Docker installed and working. Install Docker.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Select elements can require quite a bit of boiler plate code to automate. To reduce this and make your tests cleaner, there is a Select class in the Selenium support package. To use it, you will need the following import statement:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;   from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    include Selenium::WebDriver::Support   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select     You are then able to create a Select object using a WebElement that references a \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement selectElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;selectElementID\u0026#34;)); Select selectObject = new Select(selectElement);   select_element = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#39;selectElementID\u0026#39;) select_object = Select(select_element)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    select_element = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#39;selectElementID\u0026#39;) select_object = Select(select_element)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val selectElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;selectElementID\u0026#34;)) val selectObject = new Select(selectElement)     The Select object will now give you a series of commands that allow you to interact with a \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element. First of all, there are different ways of selecting an option from the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element.\n\u0026lt;select\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value1\u0026gt;Bread\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value2 selected\u0026gt;Milk\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option value=value3\u0026gt;Cheese\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/select\u0026gt; There are three ways to select the first option from the above element:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Select an \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; based upon the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element\u0026#39;s internal index selectObject.selectByIndex(1); // Select an \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; based upon its value attribute selectObject.selectByValue(\u0026#34;value1\u0026#34;);

based upon its text selectObject.selectByVisibleText(\u0026#34;Bread\u0026#34;)     You can then check which options are selected by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return a List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; of options that have been selected List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; allSelectedOptions = selectObject.getAllSelectedOptions(); // Return a WebElement referencing the first selection option found by walking down the DOM WebElement firstSelectedOption = selectObject.getFirstSelectedOption();

of options that have been selected val allSelectedOptions = selectObject.allSelectedOptions // Return a WebElement referencing the first selection option found by walking down the DOM val firstSelectedOption = selectObject.firstSelectedOption     Or you may just be interested in what \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; elements the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element contains:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Return a List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; of options that the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element contains List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt;

element contains val allAvailableOptions = selectObject.options     If you want to deselect any elements, you now have four options:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin // Deselect an \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; based upon the \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element\u0026#39;s internal index selectObject.deselectByIndex(1); // Deselect an \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; based upon its value attribute selectObject.deselectByValue(\u0026#34;value1\u0026#34;);

elements allow you to select more than one option. You can find out if your \u0026lt;select\u0026gt; element is one of these by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin Boolean doesThisAllowMultipleSelections = selectObject.isMultiple();   does_this_allow_multiple_selections = select_object.is_multiple   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    does_this_allow_multiple_selections = select_object.multiple?   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    val doesThisAllowMultipleSelections = selectObject.isMultiple     "

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Acceptance testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature matches its requirements. This generally involves the customer\u0026rsquo;s feedback or specification.\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behavior. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.\nFunctional testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature functions properly, without issues.\nThis generally include: the tests work without errors (404, exceptions\u0026hellip;), in an usable way (right redirections),\nin an accessible way and matching its specifications\n(see acceptance testing above).\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating expected returns.\nThis simulation could be done by record/playback or through\nthe different supported languages as explainedin this documentation.\nPerformance testing As its name indicates, performance tests are done in order to measure how well an application is performing.\nThere are two main sub-types for performance testing:\nLoad testing Load testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under different defined loads (usually a particular number of users connected at once)\nStress testing Stress testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under stress (or above the maximum supported load).\nGenerally, performance tests are done by executing a number of Selenium written tests simulating different users hitting a particular function on the web app and retrieving some meaningful measurements.\nThis is generally done by other tools that retrieve the metrics. One such tools is JMeter.\nFor a web application, details to measure include: throughput, latency, data loss, individual component loading times\u0026hellip;\nNote: All browsers have a performance tab in their developers\u0026rsquo; tools section (accessible by pressing F12)\nNote 2: is a subtype of non-functional testing as this is generally measured per system and not per function/feature.\nRegression testing This testing is generally done after a change, fix or feature addition.\nIn order to ensure that the change has not broken any of the existing functionality, some already executed tests are executed again.\nThe set of re-executed test can be full or partial and can include several different types, depending on the application and development team.\nTest driven development (TDD) Rather than a test type per se, TDD is an iterative development methodology in which tests drive the design of a feature.\nEach cycle starts by creating a set of unit tests that the feature should pass (which should fail their first time executed).\nAfter this, development takes place in order to make the tests pass. The tests are executed again starting another cycle and this process continues until all tests are passing.\nThis aims to speed up the development of an application based on the fact that defects are less costly the earlier they are found.\nBehavior-driven development (BDD) BDD is also an iterative development methodology based on above (TDD) in which the goal is to involve all the parties in the development of an application.\nEach cycle starts by creating some specification (which should fail). Then create the failing unit tests (which should also fail) and then create the development.\nThis cycle is repeated until all type of tests are passing.\nIn order to do so, a specification language is used. It should be understandable by all parties and simple, standard and explicit. Most tools use Gherkin as this language.\nThe goal is to be able to detect even more errors than TDD by targeting potential acceptance errors too and make communication between parties smoother.\nA set of tools are currently available in order to write the specifications and match them with code functions, such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.\nA set of tools are built on top of Selenium to make this process even faster by directly transform the BDD specifications into executable code. Some of these are: JBehave, Capybara and Robot Framework.\n"

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n For multiple reasons, logging into sites like Gmail and Facebook using WebDriver is not recommended. Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.\nThe ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth. Although using an API might seem like a bit of extra hard work, you will be paid back in speed, reliability, and stability. The API is also unlikely to change whereas webpages and HTML locators change often and require you to update your test framework.\nLogging in to third party sites using WebDriver at any point of your test increases the risk of your test failing because it makes your test longer. A general rule of thumb is that longer tests are more fragile and unreliable.\nWebDriver implementations that are W3C conformant also annotate the navigator object with a webdriver property so that Denial of Service attacks can be mitigated.\n"

	"content": "  Page being translated from English to French. Do you speak French? Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.\nFrom experience, most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver are connected to race conditions that occur between the browser and the user\u0026rsquo;s instructions. An example could be that the user instructs the browser to navigate to a page, then gets a no such element error when trying to find an element.\nConsider the following document:\n\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=utf-8\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Race Condition Example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var initialised = false; window.addEventListener(\u0026#34;load\u0026#34;, function() { var newElement = document.createElement(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); newElement.textContent = \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(newElement); initialised = true; }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The WebDriver instructions might look innocent enough:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.Text, \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox begin # Navigate to URL driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; # Get and store Paragraph Text search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert(element.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     The issue here is that the default page load strategy used in WebDriver listens for the document.readyState to change to \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot; before returning from the call to navigate. Because the p element is added after the document has completed loading, this WebDriver script might be intermittent. It “might” be intermittent because no guarantees can be made about elements or events that trigger asynchronously without explicitly waiting—or blocking—on those events.\nFortunately, using the normal instruction set available on the WebElement interface—such as WebElement.click and _WebElement.sendKeys_—are guaranteed to be synchronous, in that the function calls won\u0026rsquo;t return (or the callback won\u0026rsquo;t trigger in callback-style languages) until the command has been completed in the browser. The advanced user interaction APIs, Keyboard and Mouse, are exceptions as they are explicitly intended as “do what I say” asynchronous commands.\nWaiting is having the automated task execution elapse a certain amount of time before continuing with the next step.\nTo overcome the problem of race conditions between the browser and your WebDriver script, most Selenium clients ship with a wait package. When employing a wait, you are using what is commonly referred to as an explicit wait.\nExplicit wait Explicit waits are available to Selenium clients for imperative, procedural languages. They allow your code to halt program execution, or freeze the thread, until the condition you pass it resolves. The condition is called with a certain frequency until the timeout of the wait is elapsed. This means that for as long as the condition returns a falsy value, it will keep trying and waiting.\nSince explicit waits allow you to wait for a condition to occur, they make a good fit for synchronising the state between the browser and its DOM, and your WebDriver script.\nTo remedy our buggy instruction set from earlier, we could employ a wait to have the findElement call wait until the dynamically added element from the script has been added to the DOM:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER); // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds WebElement firstResult = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); // Print the first result System.out.println(firstResult.getText());   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait def document_initialised(driver): return driver.execute_script(\u0026#34;return initialised\u0026#34;) driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) WebDriverWait(driver).until(document_initialised) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.Url = \u0026#34;https://www.google.com/ncr\u0026#34;; driver.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).SendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.Enter); WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); IWebElement firstResult = wait.Until(e =\u0026gt; e.FindElement(By.XPath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); Console.WriteLine(firstResult.Text);   require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout =\u0026gt; 10) def document_initialised(driver) driver.execute_script(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;) end begin driver.get \u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39; wait.until{document_initialised driver} search_form = driver.find_element(:css,\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;).text \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;.eql? search_form ensure driver.quit end   const documentInitialised = () =\u0026gt; driver.executeScript(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;); await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); await driver.wait(() =\u0026gt; documentInitialised(), 10000); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);   driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;) driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER) // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds val firstResult = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))) // Print the first result println(firstResult.text)     We pass in the condition as a function reference that the wait will run repeatedly until its return value is truthy. A “truthful” return value is anything that evaluates to boolean true in the language at hand, such as a string, number, a boolean, an object (including a WebElement), or a populated (non-empty) sequence or list. That means an empty list evaluates to false. When the condition is truthful and the blocking wait is aborted, the return value from the condition becomes the return value of the wait.\nWith this knowledge, and because the wait utility ignores no such element errors by default, we can refactor our instructions to be more concise:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin WebElement foo = new WebDriverWait(driver, 3) .until(driver -\u0026gt; driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;))); assertEquals(foo.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = WebDriverWait(driver).until(lambda d: return d.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   using (var driver = new FirefoxDriver()) { var foo = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)) .Until(drv =\u0026gt; drv.FindElement(By.Name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;))); Debug.Assert(foo.Text.Equals(\u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) val ele = WebDriverWait(getWebDriver(), 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;))) assert(ele.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;)     In that example, we pass in an anonymous function (but we could also define it explicitly as we did earlier so it may be reused). The first and only argument that is passed to our condition is always a reference to our driver object, WebDriver (called d in the example). In a multi-threaded environment, you should be careful to operate on the driver reference passed in to the condition rather than the reference to the driver in the outer scope.\nBecause the wait will swallow no such element errors that are raised when the element isn\u0026rsquo;t found, the condition will retry until the element is found. Then it will take the return value, a WebElement, and pass it back through to our script.\nIf the condition fails, e.g. a truthful return value from the condition is never reached, the wait will throw/raise an error/exception called a timeout error.\nOptions The wait condition can be customised to match your needs. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary to wait the full extent of the default timeout, as the penalty for not hitting a successful condition can be expensive.\nThe wait lets you pass in an argument to override the timeout:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript Kotlin //new WebDriverWait(driver,3).until(some_condition(WebElement)) new WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=3).until(some_condition)   new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)).Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeClickable(By.XPath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)))     Expected conditions Because it\u0026rsquo;s quite a common occurrence to have to synchronise the DOM and your instructions, most clients also come with a set of predefined expected conditions. As might be obvious by the name, they are conditions that are predefined for frequent wait operations.\nThe conditions available in the different language bindings vary, but this is a non-exhaustive list of a few:\n alert is present element exists element is visible title contains title is element staleness visible text  You can refer to the API documentation for each client binding to find an exhaustive list of expected conditions:\n Java\u0026rsquo;s org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions class Python\u0026rsquo;s selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions class .NET\u0026rsquo;s OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.ExpectedConditions type  Implicit wait There is a second type of wait that is distinct from explicit wait called implicit wait. By implicitly waiting, WebDriver polls the DOM for a certain duration when trying to find any element. This can be useful when certain elements on the webpage are not available immediately and need some time to load.\nImplicit waiting for elements to appear is disabled by default and will need to be manually enabled on a per-session basis. Mixing explicit waits and implicit waits will cause unintended consequences, namely waits sleeping for the maximum time even if the element is available or condition is true.\nWarning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.\nAn implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available.

It refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver or sometimes as Selenium 2.\nSelenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0\n WebDriver is designed in a simpler and more concise programming interface along with addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API.\n WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API when compared to Selenium 1.0.\n It drives the browser much more effectively and overcomes the limitations of Selenium 1 that affected our functional test coverage, like the file upload or download, pop-ups, and dialogs barrier.\n WebDriver overcomes the limitation of Selenium RC\u0026rsquo;s single-host origin policy.\n  "

Help us to translate it by sending us pull requests!\n Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is generally not advised. Not because it is incapable but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.\nIt may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself. Variation at these points will cause variation in your results. It is difficult to separate the difference between the performance of your website and the performance of external resources, and it is also hard to tell what the performance penalty is for using WebDriver in the browser, especially if you are injecting scripts.\nThe other potential attraction is \u0026ldquo;saving time\u0026rdquo; — carrying out functional and performance tests at the same time. However, functional and performance tests have opposing objectives. To test functionality, a tester may need to be patient and wait for loading, but this will cloud the performance testing results and vice versa.\nTo improve the performance of your website, you will need to be able to analyse overall performance independent of environment differences, identify poor code practices, breakdown of performance of individual resources (i.e. CSS or JavaScript) in order to know what to improve. There are performance testing tools available that can do this job already, and which provide reporting and analysis which can even make improvement suggestions.\nExample (open source) packages to use are: JMeter\n"

	"content": " Selenium est un gros projet logiciel\net sa documentation est la clé pour comprendre comment fonctionnent les choses et apprendre à exploiter son potentiel efficacement.\nUne partie de la documentation Selenium est toujours hébergée sur notre dépôt www.seleniumhq.org. Cependant nous abandonnons progressivement cette documentation qui se concrentre trop sur Selenium RC et autres parties obsolètes, en faveur de cette réécriture.\nC\u0026rsquo;est un projet démarré dans le but de réécrire la documentation Selenium à partir de zéro. C\u0026rsquo;est un effort continu (sans cible de release spécifique) dans le but de fournir un manuel à jour sur l\u0026rsquo;utilisation effective de Selenium. Nous espérons rappatrier les parties de l\u0026rsquo;ancienne documentation lorsque nécessaire.\nLes contributions à cette nouvelle documentation suivent le process décrit dans la section Contribution ci-dessous. Il est recommandé de se familiariser avec la documentation en enlisant un peu plus ici.\nLe projet Selenium accueille tout type de contribution. Voici les différentes aides que vous pouvez apporter:\nSignaler un problème Lorsque vous signalez une nouveau issue ou en commentez une existante, merci de vous assurer que la discussion se concentre sur des problèmes techniques concrets liés à Selenium et/ou sa documentation.\nTous les composants de Selenium évoluent assez rapidement au cours du temps, ce qui peut engendrer une documentation dépassée. Si cela se trouve être le cas, comme mentionné précédemment n\u0026rsquo;hésitez pas à créer une issue. Il se peut que vous souhaitiez également contribuer à mettre à jour la documentation, dans ce cas envoyez nous une pull request avec les modifications associées.\nSi vous avez un doute sur la réalité d\u0026rsquo;un problème que vous rencontrez, merci de d\u0026rsquo;abord poser la question à la mailing list selenium-users@, ou de nous rejoindre sur le canal #selenium sur irc.freenode.org ou Slack.\nContributions Le projet Selenium appécie les nouveaux contributeurs. Les personnes contribuant de façon significative et répétée dans le temps sont promus Committers et ont un commit-access sur le projet.\nCe document va vous guider à travers le process de contribution.\nEtape 1: Fork Forker le projet sur Github et faites un check out sur votre copie locale.\n% git clone git@github.com:username/docs.git % cd docs % git remote add upstream git://github.com/seleniumhq/docs.git Dépendences: Hugo La documentation utilise Hugo afin de construire et afficher le site. Afin de tester localement avant de commiter tout changement, merci d\u0026rsquo;installer Hugo et de démarrer le serveur local pour afficher le site en local.\nEtape 2: Branch Créez une branche pour votre fonctionnalité et commencez à faire vos modifications:\n% git checkout -b my-feature-branch Nous utilisons un développement basé sur le HEAD, ce qui veut dire que tous les changements sont appliqués directement sur le master.\nEtape 3: Commit Assurez-vous d\u0026rsquo;abord que git connaisse votre nom et votre adresse mail:\n% git config --global user.name \u0026#39;Santa Claus\u0026#39; % git config --global user.email \u0026#39;santa@example.com\u0026#39; Ecrire de bon message de commit est important. Un message de commit devrait décrire le changement, la raison du changement, et référencer les issues corrigées (si nécessaire). Suivez les lignes directrices suivantes:\n La première ligne devrait faire approximativement 50 caractères ou moins et contenir une description courte du changement La seoncde ligne doit rester vide Retourner à la ligne à la colonne 72 pour chaque ligne du corps du message Inclure Fixes #N, lorsque nécessaire. Où N est le numéro de li\u0026rsquo;ssue que le commit corrige  Un bon message de commit peut ressembler à ceci:\nexplique le commit en une ligne Corps du commit de message constitué de quelques lignes, expliquant les choses de façon plus détaillé, contextualisant si besoin le problème corrigé, etc. Le corps du message peut être constitué de plusieurs paragraphes. Et encore merci de garder des lignes de moins de 72 caractères. Grâce à cela, la sortie de `git log` restera propre même avec indentation. Fixes #141 La première ligne doit être la plus parlante possible, c\u0026rsquo;est ce que les gens verront lors d\u0026rsquo;un git shortlog ou git log --oneline.\nEtape 4: Rebase Faites un git rebase (et non pas git merge) afin de synchroniser votre travail de temps en temps.\n% git fetch upstream % git rebase upstream/master Etape 5: Test Rappelez-vous bien de toujours lancer le serveur local, pour vous assurez que vos changements non rien cassé.\nEtape 6: Traduction Si vous mettez à jour des infos, en ajouter de nouvelles, ou supprimer des infos obsolètes, merci de garder la traduction à jour également. Bien sûr il est possible que vous ne parliez pas toutes les langues disponibles. Dans ce cas, créez une nouvelle issue dans laquelle vous décrivez clairement que telle partie de la documentation a évolué et qu\u0026rsquo;une traduction est nécessaire. De cette manière, un contributeur parlant une des langues disponibles pourra intervenir et nous aider à garder la traduction à jour.\nEtape 7: Signer le CLA Avant que nous puissions accepter, nous vous demandons de signer un Contributor License Agreement (ou CLA). Et ce afin de nous assurer que les contributeurs ont le droit de céder leur code.\nLorsque vous ouvrez votre pull request, nous vous demandons d\u0026rsquo;indiquer que vous avez signé le CLA. Cela réduira d\u0026rsquo;autant le temps d\u0026rsquo;intégration de votre demande.\nEtape 8: Push % git push origin my-feature-branch Rendez-vous sur https://github.com/yourusername/site.git et cliquez sur le bouton Pull Request et remplissez le formulaire. Merci d\u0026rsquo;indiquer que vous avez signé le CLA (voir Etape 7).\nLes Pull Requests sont généralement traitées en quelques jours. Si il y a des commentaires à prendre en compte de votre part, appliquer vos modifications dans de nouveaux commits (de préférence via fixups) et faites un push sur la même branche.\nEtape 9: Intégration Lorsque la revue de code est terminée, un commiter intégrera votre PR sur la branche gh-pages de la documentation. Comme nous aimons garder un historique linéraire de la branche master, nous ferons normalement un squash et rebase de l\u0026rsquo;historique de votre branche.\nCommunication Les contributeurs Selenium fréquentent le canal #selenium sur irc.freenode.org ou sur Slack. vous pouvez également rejoindre la mailing list selenium-developers@.\n"

Test design theory is something that I have yet to really see covered much, so here are three articles on the similar idea of what to test and what to skip.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #23</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-23/</guid><description>I was at Agile 2010 in Orlando last week so missed doing the Smattering, so here is two weeks worth of links.
There is crazy amounts of power hiding in that there JUnit 4 library – such as @Rule. One usage of them is described here. A useful pattern indeed when doing something like BDD or ATDD The next SFSE has been announced; August 24 at LinkedIn. Se creator Jason Huggins will be fielding questions in a Q&amp;amp;A session on steroids.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #22</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</guid><description>Happy Simcoe Day. Only a handful of links this week to mention.
Kevin relaunched Mogotest – see your website the way your users do. In a much earlier Smattering I think I linked to an announcement about a Se talk at Boston.rb. Well, here are the slides While not directly related to Se, the W3C has released their Unified Validator called, wait for it, Unicorn. So who is going to create the integration that magically sends pages to be validated there?</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #21</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-21/</guid><description>I thought it had been a slow week — until I looked at how many browser windows I had open. I wonder if that was why things were feeling a bit sluggish…
Some bits of history from Simon Stewart
First announcement of Selenium (outside of Thoughtworks) First announcement of WebDriver (again, outside of Thoughtworks) The ‘merger’ announcement (aka Selenium 2) More history lessons on Cloud Computing Show #35 where Jason recounts the origin of Se (and other stuff)</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #20</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-20/</guid><description>12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that’s my excuse and I’m sticking with it. Enjoy. I’m going for a nap.
The big news this week was the next alpha of Se 2 came out. Time to update those automation machines. Like TestNG’s @BeforeClass and @AfterClass but using JUnit4? Using JUnit Nested Suites with Selenium RC to simulate TestNG suite and grouping annotations is a long titled post, but describes how to fake one out to act like the other.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #19</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-19/</guid><description>I’ve got a full day of driving ahead of me to go to a client so this is the early-morning (for me) edition of the Smattering post. That of course means there will be an absolute link explosion in about 20 minutes.
Dave talks about some of the stuff he is doing with Se-IDE in the post Improving Selenium IDE Another post on how to deal with file downloads in Se.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #18</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-18/</guid><description>Not too much this week with various holidays around the world, but still managed to dig some things up.
Sauce Labs has started a webinar series and recently had one on using Cucumber and OnDemand. Cucumber and Robot Framework like tools are the coming wave of testing tools. Another bit of Sauce-ish news is the folks at Rally put up a post on how to get Se 2 scripts in their OnDemand cloud If writing Se scripts is ‘programming’, then writing the controlling frameworks is real programming.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #17</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-17/</guid><description>Here are the posts dealing with Se, and/or automation in general that caught my eye and interest.
Selenium Unit Test Reuse illustrates one way of iterating through environments and browsers in a script without using Se-Grid. I’ve done similar tricks to this to some success — the problem is usually reporting though, but you are all clever folks so I’m sure you could add it in. Adding a custom header is sometimes required when writing a script, but its not really that documented so Kevin wrote How to Perform Basic Authentication in Selenium which combines how to do basic auth and header injection.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #16</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-16/</guid><description>I’m going to start posting the Smattering posts here on the main Selenium blog, hopefully each Monday.

Style Tests using Selenium and Robotframework – With those simple steps we are able to do regression testing on our user interfaces that have strict standards Export Selenium IDE scripts for Grails – A plugin which does exactly what the announcement says.

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of the first beta of Selenium
4. We&amp;rsquo;re shipping this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript,
so if you&amp;rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your
package manager of choice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has been the culmination of a lot of work by so many people, not
only the &lt;a href="/structure/#tlc">project TLC&lt;/a>, but also of literally hundreds of people:
205 since we released Selenium 3.141.59, at the last count. A big
thank you to everybody who&amp;rsquo;s helped make this possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s changed since Selenium 3? The answer is both &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;
and also &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that if your tests are working with Selenium
3 right now, you should be able to just upgrade your dependency to
Selenium 4. You will find that things that were marked &amp;ldquo;deprecated&amp;rdquo;
are now gone, but the advantage of the long time between the last
Selenium 3 release and this is that you&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of time to try
and find alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, please let us know! We&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure
compatibility between the releases, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible we may have
missed some things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the
drivers you need. In particular, please update &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> to
0.29.0 or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that under the covers there have
been substantial changes. We&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten the Selenium server to allow
it to work not only in the familiar &amp;ldquo;standalone&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hub and node&amp;rdquo;
modes, but also in a new &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; mode, which makes it
signifcantly easier to deploy to something such as Kubernetes in a way
that scales well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new server is also wired up with support for &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry&lt;/a> and
exposes a &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.0.0-beta-1/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/graphql/selenium-grid-schema.graphqls">GraphQL endpoint&lt;/a>, so that figuring what&amp;rsquo;s going
on in the Grid, and tracking down what&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong if something
happens, is easier than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not all the changes are server-side. We recently wrote about the &lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/">new
features in Selenium 4&lt;/a> that you can use in your tests, but some
of the main highlights are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relative locators, for finding elements using terms that make
sense to us humans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ability to intercept network traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication with basic or digest authentication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be telling you more about these features in later blog posts,
and as we improve our documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this sounds interesting, please download the beta from your
favourite package manager (maven, nuget, npm, pip, or the gem), or
directly from the &lt;a href="/downloads">Selenium site&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</title><link>/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better — in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the confusion began. Let’s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.03; when is the 1.0.4 release?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Se-RC 1.0.4 is planned for sometime towards the end of July 2010&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I’ve heard rumours that 1.0.4 the to be the final release?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes. 1.0.4 is &lt;em>planned&lt;/em> on being the final 1.x release&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>That’s crazy talk! I can’t use a .0 or ‘alpha’ release for my mission critical application&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, its not all &lt;em>that&lt;/em> crazy — and needs a bit more explanation. Se2 is truly a merger of the two projects, in fact 2.0a1 was literally the Se code from the OpenQA repository and the WebDriver code its Google Code repository merged into a &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium">new one&lt;/a>. This meant that from the first release of the 2.x series, it has contained 100% of the 1.x code which means 100% backwards compatibility. Later releases in the 2.x series have been driven primarily by evolutions of the code that came from WebDriver, &lt;em>not from Se 1.x&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OK, so 100% of Se 1.x is in 2.x; I get that. But how are you making sure that fixes to one get into the other?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is another ‘secret’ — don’t tell anyone, but there hasn’t been any pure 1.x development since the merging of the codebases. Every 1.x release since the merger has really been a 2.x release — but all packaged up to make it look like a 1.x release. This is why observant people have noticed a log message that looks something like &lt;em>11:09:37.507 INFO – v2.0 [a4], with Core v2.0 [a4]&lt;/em> when they start up their 1.x server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>So you’ve been releasing &lt;em>alpha&lt;/em> code disguised as a stable release? Jerks!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woah! Relax! Recall what I said above about it being backwards compatible by default. The ‘alpha’ tag is there because the API for the new code is still being developed and features flushed out. The 1.x code is however, still stable and still production quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Alright, I take back calling you folks jerks, but I really don’t like the alpha tag. When will it be out of ‘alpha’?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is only one or two more features to implement (like handling alerts) in the WebDriver code and some cleanup before the betas start. But hope for a 2.0.0 final by the end of the year. And while we’re on the topic of ‘alpha’ vs. ‘beta’, this the team’s working definitions of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Alpha&lt;/em> – APIs can, and likely will change. Possibly in dramatic ways.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Beta&lt;/em> – With the APIs set, make sure they work with the major browsers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>‘Major Browsers’ eh, what exactly does that mean?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now it means Firefox, Internet Explorer and at least one WebKit based one (Safari or Chrome)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short… it is a requirement of Se2 that the server be backwards compatible with Se-RC 1.x and that has already been accomplished by building the code from a common source repository. This means that if you are using Se-RC, you can switch out the server for a 2.x one and have no impact on the execution of the scripts. &lt;em>Plus&lt;/em> you can start to experiment with the new stuff that came over from WebDriver.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

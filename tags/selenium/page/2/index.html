            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/"><h2>Selenium 3 is Coming</h2></a>
            <p><a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 3</a> is coming! As I write this, we think that &#8220;beta 4&#8221; will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.</p>
<h3>TL;DR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x.</li>
<li>Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update.</li>
<li>The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</li>
<li>The Selenium RC APIs have been moved to a “legacy” package.</li>
<li>The original code powering Selenium RC has been replaced with something backed by WebDriver, which is also contained in the “legacy” package.</li>
<li>By a quirk of timing, Mozilla have made changes to Firefox that mean that from Firefox 48 you must use their geckodriver to use that browser, regardless of whether you’re using Selenium 2 or 3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In more depth:</h3>
<p>When we <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">released Selenium 2.0</a> in 2011, we introduced the new WebDriver APIs, and encouraged everyone to start moving to them. If you’re using the WebDriver APIs, then Selenium 3.0 is a simple drop-in upgrade. We’ve not changed any of the public WebDriver APIs, and the code is essentially the same as the last 2.x release. If you’re using Selenium Grid, the same applies: in most cases, you can just drop in the new JAR (or update your maven dependency to 3.0.0), and you’re done.</p>
<p>If the update to Selenium 3 is such a non-event, why did we call this Selenium 3.0? To answer this question, I first need to provide some history, and tell you a little about how Selenium works under the hood. The very first version of Selenium was “just” a very complicated Javascript framework, running in the browser and interpreting the table-based tests you may be familiar with if you use Selenium IDE. We call this “Selenium Core”. This Javascript framework formed the basis of the original implementation of Selenium RC (the oldest set of Selenium APIs, where all the method and functions were on the “<a href="http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html">Selenium</a>” interface, and which have been deprecated for some time now). Over time, the needs of modern web testing have grown ever more complicated and sophisticated, and Selenium Core is now less capable of meeting these needs than it was before.</p>
<p>With Selenium 3.0, we are deleting the original Selenium Core implementation. If you use the old RC interfaces, we provide an alternative implementation that’s backed by WebDriver. This is the same “webdriver-backed selenium” that has been available as part of Selenium 2 since its release. Because the underlying technology has changed from Selenium Core to WebDriver, you may find some places where your existing tests using RC run into issues. Our experience with migrating suites is that it’s normally a systemic issue that can be fixed with a minimal engineering effort (that is, the problem is normally isolated to a few places, and these can be rewritten to avoid problems)</p>
<p>We’re also removing the original Selenium RC APIs from the main downloads. If you’re a Java user, and need to use them to support existing tests, then you’ll need a dependency to “org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-leg-rc:3.0.0” (or later!). It’s strongly recommended that you do not do this unless you absolutely need to.<br />
If you’re someone who runs tests exported from IDE in the table format, there is now a new test runner that the project has made available for you to use that can be <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">downloaded</a> from the project’s website. It takes the same arguments as the old runner, and we’ve done our best to ensure the output of tests remains the same too.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Selenium project is shipping Selenium 3.0, Mozilla are changing the internals of Firefox in a way that makes it more stable and secure, but which also makes the community provided Firefox Driver no longer work. As such, if you use Firefox for your testing, you’ll need to use the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver</a>, which is an executable similar to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">chromedriver</a> and the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Microsoft WebDriver</a> for Edge. You’ll need to start using geckodriver even if you’re using Selenium 2 — the change is in the browser, not Selenium. Please be aware that geckodriver is alpha software, based on the evolving W3C WebDriver standard: everyone&#8217;s working flat out to give you the best testing experience they can, but there are undoubtedly some bumps in the road when it comes to testing with Firefox.</p>
<p>This release marks the culmination of a lot of hard work by the Selenium committers and community. I’d like to thank everyone who has been part of this process, and the Selenium users around the world who have done so much to make the project as successful as it is.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/"><h2>Announcing Selenium 3.0-beta1</h2></a>
            <p>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released &#8220;by Christmas&#8221;. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We&#8217;re excited to announce the release of the first beta &#8212; Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.0 itself! Please remember that this is a beta release, so your feedback is incredibly helpful and valuable in order to help us smooth any rough edges.</p>
<p>For the last six years we&#8217;ve been advising users to switch to the newer WebDriver APIs and to stop using the original RC APIs. With Selenium 3.0, the original implementation of RC has been removed, replaced by one that sits on top of WebDriver. For many users, this change will go completely unnoticed, as they&#8217;re no longer using the RC APIs. For those of you who still are, we&#8217;ve done our best to make the change as smooth as possible, but <a href="https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues">we welcome high quality bug reports</a> to help us fix any problems that occur. Maven users will need to add a dependency on the new &#8220;<a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/maven.jsp">leg-rc</a>&#8221; package to access the old RC APIs.</p>
<p>There are some other changes that you might need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You&#8217;ll need to be running Java 8</strong> to use the Java pieces of Selenium. This is the oldest version of Java officially supported by Oracle, so hopefully you&#8217;re using it already!</li>
<li>Support for Firefox is via Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver</a>.</li>
<li>Support for Safari is provided on macOS (Sierra or later) via Apple&#8217;s own <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_10_0.html">safaridriver</a>.</li>
<li>Support for Edge is provided by MS through their <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">webdriver server</a>.</li>
<li>Only versions 9 or above of IE are supported. Earlier versions may work, but are no longer supported as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">MS no longer supports them</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll be posting more information about Selenium 3.0 to this blog soon, but until then if you&#8217;re interested in learning more then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bistojJPR98">a recent webinar by Simon</a> is a great place to start.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/"><h2>Android and iOS Support</h2></a>
            <p>TL;DR: We&#8217;re retiring Selenium&#8217;s own AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver in favour of any of <a href="http://selendroid.io/">Selendroid</a>, <a href="http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/">iosdriver</a> and <a href="http://appium.io/">Appium</a>. If you&#8217;re using one of Selenium&#8217;s own mobile drivers, please evaluate one of these alternatives.</p>
<p>The longer version:</p>
<p>In 2007, Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone.html">announced the iPhone</a> and changed the mobile Web from a curiosity to something the mainstream wanted and used. Current trends suggest that mobile Web usage will surpass desktop usage in the not too distant future. Which is a long way of saying the mobile Web is going to be a big part of the future of your sites and that it&#8217;d be an extremely wise idea to test them on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The Selenium project responded to the rise of the mobile web by working to produce WebDriver implementations for both iOS and Android. The first lines of the iPhoneDriver (which also worked on the iPad) were added to the project early in 2009. The AndroidDriver was added in June 2010, and was primarily developed by engineers at Google. To this day you can download the official Android SDK and find &#8220;<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-android-webdriver.html">Google WebDriver</a>&#8221; as one of the optional extras you can download.</p>
<p>After the initial work on the mobile drivers, something interesting happened. Experimental extensions and modifications to the drivers were made outside of the selenium project. The first one of these that I was involved with was &#8220;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/nativedriver/">nativedriver</a>&#8220;. This took the novel approach of allowing users to interact with the native UI of the phone, be it Android or iOS, using the familiar WebDriver APIs. The first time I saw it, I thought it was madness, but the engineers working on it soon convinced me that it made sense. And guess what? They were right.</p>
<p>Sadly, after proving the idea was viable and workable, the NativeDriver project ran out of steam, but it set the scene for three projects that have taken the idea and run with it to create remarkably capable pieces of mobile testing software: Selendroid, iosdriver and Appium. All three of these allow a tester familiar with the WebDriver APIs to test mobile apps on iOS and Android. Not only native ones, but also hybrid or pure web-based ones too. They&#8217;ve recently been joined by the <a href="http://winphonewebdriver.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone WebDriver</a>, which allows testing of mobile web apps on WinPhone 8.</p>
<p>All of these projects have something in common: they&#8217;re far more active, more capable and have pushed further than the equivalent code in the main selenium project. In fact, some of the members of the selenium team that contributed to both AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver are now also working on those other projects. There&#8217;s <a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2013/09/the-mobile-json-wire-protocol-workshop/">work being done</a> to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse?repo=mobile">maintain interoperability</a> between the different drivers, allowing users to chose which framework is most appropriate for their needs without fear of their tests needing major rework.</p>
<p>This means that keeping the existing Android and iPhone drivers within the Selenium project isn&#8217;t helping our users. The alternatives are better, and keeping &#8220;official&#8221; drivers within the project muddies the water. Worse, the selenium developers are slow at making fixes to those drivers, which is incredibly frustrating for everyone involved. Because of this, the Selenium project has deleted the code for those drivers from its repository and we recommend you evaluate and use one of the alternatives.</p>
<p>Of course, the code will still live in our repo&#8217;s history, so if you&#8217;d like to build them yourself, then it&#8217;s still possible. The last version with the iPhoneDriver is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=ef9d5787e5e136ecb4a31b0cf53a1fd17e252cf3">ef9d578</a>, and the last one with the Android source is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=00a3c7df9fb4109e1f99b5f7bee5f5df74fb876a">00a3c7d</a>. We&#8217;ve uploaded a version of the AndroidDriver built from that revision to the downloads page to save you having to do so yourself.</p>
<p>These changes do not mean that we don&#8217;t support mobile as a project. It just means that we support the best implementations of mobile WebDriver, and those aren&#8217;t written as part of the Selenium project.</p>

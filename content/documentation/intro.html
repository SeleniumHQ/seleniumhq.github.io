<h2>The Selenium project and tools</h2>


<h3>Selenium controls web browsers</h3>

<p><em>Selenium</em> is many things,
 but at its core it's a toolset for web browser automation
 that uses the best techniques available
 to remotely control browser instances
 and emulate a user's interaction with the browser.

<p>It allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users;
 entering text into fields,
 selecting drop-down values and checking boxes,
 and clicking links in documents.
 It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement,
 arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.

<p>Although used primarily for front-end testing of websites,
 Selenium is at its core a browser user agent <em>library</em>.
 The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application,
 which encourages composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.


<h3>One interface to rule them all</h3>

<p>One of the project's guiding principles
 is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies.
 Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications,
 performing their operations in completely different ways
 but which frequently look the same while doing so.
 Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts,
 the images are displayed in the same place
 and the links take you to the same destination.
 What is happening underneath is as different as night and day.
 Selenium “abstracts” these differences,
 hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code.
 This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow,
 but these same lines will execute on Firefox,
 Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.


<h3>Tools and support</h3>

<p>Selenium's minimalist design approach gives it
 versatility to be included as a component in bigger applications.
 The surrounding infrastructure provided under the Selenium umbrella
 gives you the tools to put together
 your own <a href="/documentation/grid">grid of browsers</a>
 so tests can be run on different browsers and multiple operating systems
 across a range of machines.

<p>Imagine a bank of computers in your server room or data centre
 all firing up browsers at the same time
 hitting your site's links, forms,
 and tables&mdash;testing your application 24 hours a day.
 Through the simple programming interface
 provided for the most common languages,
 these tests will run tirelessly in parallel,
 reporting back to you when errors occur.

<p>It's an aim to help make this a reality for you,
 by providing users with tools and documentation to not only control browsers,
 but to make it easy to scale and deploy such grids.


<h3>Who uses Selenium</h3>

<p>Many of the most important companies in the world
 have adopted Selenium for their browser-based testing,
 often replacing years-long efforts involving other proprietary tools.
 As it has grown in popularity, so have its requirements and challenges multiplied.

<p>As the web becomes more complicated
 and new technologies are added to websites,
 it's the mission of this project to keep up with them where possible.
 Being an open source project,
 this support is provided through the generous donation of time from many volunteers,
 every one of which has a “day job”.

<p>Another mission of the project is to encourage
 more volunteers to partake in this effort,
 and build a strong community
 so that the project can continue to keep up with emerging technologies
 and remain a dominant platform for functional test automation.


<h3>History</h3>

<p>When Selenium 1 was released in 2004,
 it was out of the necessity to reduce time spent
 manually verifying consistent behaviour in the front-end of a web application.
 It made use of what tools were available at the time,
 and relied heavily on the injection of JavaScript to the web page under test
 to emulate a user's interaction.

<p>Whilst JavaScript is a good tool to let you introspect the properties of the DOM
 and to do certain client-side observations that you would otherwise not be able to do,
 it falls short on the ability to naturally replicate a user's interactions
 as if the mouse and keyboard are being used.

<p>Since then, Selenium has grown and matured a lot,
 into a tool widely used by many&mdash;if not most&mdash;of
 the largest organisations around the world.
 Selenium has gone from a homebrewed test automation toolkit developed at Thoughtworks
 for a niché audience and a specific use case,
 to the world's <em>de facto</em> browser automation library.

<p>Just as Selenium RC made use of the tools of the trade available at the time,
 <a href="documentation/wd">Selenium WebDriver</a> drives that tradition on by taking
 the browser interaction part to the browser vendor's home turf,
 and asking them to take responsibility of the backend, browser-facing implementations.
 Recently this work has evolved into a W3C standardisation process
 where the goal is to turn the WebDriver component in Selenium
 into the <em>du jeur</em> remote control library for user agents.


<h2>On test automation</h2>

<p>First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser.
 Odds are good that, at some point, if you're working on a complex web application,
 you will need to open a browser and actually test it.

<p>Functional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however.
 Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure
 to be in place to be run effectively.
 It's a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test
 can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests
 or with a lower-level approach.

<p>Once you have made the determination that you're in the web browser testing business,
 and you have your Selenium environment ready to begin writing tests,
 you will generally perform some combination of three steps:

<ol>
 <li>Set up the data
 <li>Perform a discrete set of actions
 <li>Evaluate the results
</ol>

<p>You will want to keep these steps as short as possible;
 one to two operations should be enough much of the time.
 Browser automation has the reputation of being “flaky”,
 but in reality that is because users frequently demand too much of it.
 In later chapters, we will return to techniques you can use
 to mitigate apparent intermittent problems in tests,
 in particular on how to <a href="/documentation/wd#waits">overcome race conditions</a>
 between the browser and WebDriver.

<p>By keeping your tests short
 and using the web browser only when you have absolutely no alternative,
 you can have many tests with minimal flake.

<p>A distinct advantage of Selenium tests
 are their inherent ability to test all components of the application,
 from backend to frontend, from a user's perspective.
 So in other words, whilst functional tests may be expensive to run,
 they also encompass large business-critical portions at one time.


<h3>Testing requirements</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, Selenium tests can be expensive to run.
 To what extent depends on the browser you're running the tests against,
 but historically browsers' behaviour has varied so much that it has often
 been a stated goal to cross-test against multiple browsers.

<p>Selenium allows you to run the same instructions against multiple browsers
 on multiple operating systems,
 but the enumeration of all the possible browsers,
 their different versions, and the many operating systems they run on
 will quickly become a non-trival undertaking.


<h3>Let’s start with an example</h3>

<p>Larry has written a web site which allows users to order their own
 custom unicorns.

<p>The general workflow (what we'll call the “happy path”) is something
 like this:

<ul>
 <li>Create an account
 <li>Configure their unicorn
 <li>Add her to the shopping cart
 <li>Check out and pay
 <li>Give feedback about their unicorn
</ul>

<p>It would be tempting to write one grand Selenium script
 to perform all these operations–many will try.
 <strong>Resist the temptation!</strong>
 Doing so will result in a test that
 (a) takes a long time,
 (b) will be subject to some common issues around page rendering timing issues, and
 (c) is such that if it fails,
 it won't give you a concise, “glanceable” method for diagnosing what went wrong.

<p>The preferred strategy for testing this scenario would be
 to break it down to a series of independent, speedy tests,
 each of which has one “reason” to exist.

<p>Let's pretend you want to test the second step:
 Configuring your unicorn.
 It will perform the following actions:

<ul>
 <li>Create an account
 <li>Configure a unicorn
</ul>

<p>Note that we're skipping the rest of these steps–
 we will test the rest of the workflow in other <small>small, discrete test cases</small>,
 after we're done with this one.

<p>To start off, you need to create an account.
 Here you have some choices to make:

<ul>
 <li>Do you want to use an existing account?
 <li>Do you want to create a new account?
 <li>Are there any special properties of such a user that need to be
  taken into account before configuration begins?
</ul>

<p>Regardless of how you answer this question,
 the solution is to make it part of the “set up the data” portion of the test–
 if Larry has exposed an API which enables you (or anyone)
 to create and update user accounts,
 be sure to use that to answer this question–
 if possible, you want to launch the browser only after you have a user “in hand”,
 whose credentials you can just log in with.

<p>If each test for each workflow begins with the creation of a user account,
 many seconds will be added to the execution of each test.
 Calling an API and talking to a database are quick,
 “headless” operations that don't require the expensive process of
 opening a browser, navigating to the right pages,
 clicking and waiting for the forms to be submitted, etc.

<p>Ideally, you can address this set-up phase in one line of code,
 which will execute before any browser is launched:

<pre><code class=java>// Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn,
// but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have
// administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email
// address and password are randomly generated--you don't even need to
// know them.
User user = UserFactory.createCommonUser(); //This method is defined elsewhere.

// Log in as this user.
// Logging in on this site takes you to your personal "My Account" page, so the
// AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then
// perform actions from the AccountPage.
AccountPage accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());</code></pre>

<p>As you can imagine, the <code>UserFactory</code> can be extended
 to provide methods such as <code>createAdminUser()</code>, and <code>createUserWithPayment()</code>.
 The point is, these two lines of code do not distract you from the ultimate purpose of this test:
 configuring a unicorn.

<p>The intricacies of the <a href="/documentation/guidelines#page_object_models">Page Object model</a>
 will be discussed in later chapters, but we will introduce the concept here:

<p>Your tests should be composed of actions,
 performed from the user's point of view,
 within the context of pages in the site.
 These pages are stored as objects,
 which will contain specific information about how the web page is composed
 and how actions are performed–
 very little of which should concern you as a tester.

<p>What kind of unicorn do you want?
 You might want pink, but not necessarily.
 Purple has been quite popular lately.
 Does she need sunglasses? Star tattoos?
 These choices, while difficult, are your primary concern as a tester–
 you need to ensure that your order fulfillment center
 sends out the right unicorn to the right person,
 and that starts with these choices.

<p>Notice that nowhere in that paragraph do we talk about buttons,
 fields, drop-downs, radio buttons, or web forms.
 <strong>Neither should your tests!</strong>
 You want to write your code like the user trying to solve their problem.
 Here is one way of doing this (continuing from the previous example):

<pre><code class=java>// The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. 
// This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact
// with the browser in any way.
Unicorn sparkles = new Unicorn("Sparkles", UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS);

// Since we're already "on" the account page, we have to use it to get to the
// actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the "Add Unicorn" method
// takes us there.
AddUnicornPage addUnicornPage = accountPage.addUnicorn();

// Now that we're on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the "sparkles" object to
// its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles' attributes,
// fill out the form, and click submit.
UnicornConfirmationPage unicornConfirmationPage = addUnicornPage.createUnicorn(sparkles);</code></pre>

<p>Now that you've configured your unicorn,
 you need to move on to step 3: making sure it actually worked.

<pre><code class=java>// The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles 
// object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare
// them with the fields on the page.
Assert.assertTrue("Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact", unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles));</code></pre>

<p>Note that the tester still hasn't done anything but talk about unicorns in this code–
 no buttons, no locators, no browser controls.
 This method of <em>modelling</em> the application
 allows you to keep these test-level commands in place and unchanging,
 even if Larry decides next week that he no longer likes Ruby-on-Rails
 and decides to re-implement the entire site
 in the latest Haskell bindings with a Fortran front-end.

<p>Your page objects will require some small maintenance
 in order to conform to the site redesign,
 but these tests will remain the same.
 Taking this basic design,
 you will want to keep going through your workflows with the fewest browser-facing steps possible.
 Your next workflow will involve adding a unicorn to the shopping cart.
 You will probably want many iterations of this test in order to make sure the cart is keeping its state properly:
 Is there more than one unicorn in the cart before you start?
 How many can fit in the shopping cart?
 If you create more than one with the same name and/or features, will it break?
 Will it only keep the existing one or will it add another?

<p>Each time you move through the workflow,
 you want to try to avoid having to create an account,
 login as the user, and configure the unicorn.
 Ideally, you'll be able to create an account
 and pre-configure a unicorn via the API or database.
 Then all you have to do is log in as the user, locate Sparkles,
 and add her to the cart.


<h2>Types of testing</h2>

<p>TODO: Add paragraphs about acceptance testing, performance testing,
 load testing, regression testing, test driven development, and/or
 behavior-driven development (JBehave, Capybara, & Robot Framework),
 with how they relate to Selenium.


<h2>About this documentation</h2>

<p>These docs, like the code itself, are maintained 100% by volunteers
 within the Selenium community.
 Many have been using it since its inception,
 but many more have only been using it for a short while,
 and have given their time to help improve the on-boarding experience
 for new users.

<p>If there is an issue with the documentation, we want to know!
 The best way to communicate an issue is to visit
 <a href=//github.com/seleniumhq/docs/issues>https://github.com/seleniumhq/docs/issues</a>
 and search to see whether or not the issue has been filed already.
 If not, feel free to open one!

<p>Many members of the community frequent

<h1>Selenium Grid</h1>

<p><em>Selenium Grid</em> is a smart proxy server
 that allows Selenium tests to route commands to remote web browser instances.
 Its aim is to provide an easy way to run tests in parallel on multiple machines.

<p>With Selenium Grid,
 one server acts as the hub that routes JSON formatted test commands
 to one or more registered Grid nodes.
 Tests contact the hub to obtain access to remote browser instances.
 The hub has a list of registered servers that it provides access to,
 and allows us to control these instances.

<p>Selenium Grid allows us to run tests in parallel on multiple machines,
 and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally
 (instead of in each individual test).

<p>Selenium Grid isn't a silver bullet.
 It solves a subset of common delegation and distribution problems,
 but will for example not manage your infrastructure
 and might not suit your specific needs.

        <li>Takes instructions from client and executes them remotely on the nodes</li>
        <li>Manages threads</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <em>hub</em> is a central point where all your tests are sent to.
        Each Selenium Grid consists of exactly one hub. The hub needs to be reachable from the
        respective clients (i.e. CI server, Developer machine etc.)
        The hub will connect one or more nodes
        that tests will be delegated to.


    <dt>Nodes</dt>
    <ul>
        <li>This is where the browsers live</li>
        <li>Registers itself to the hub and commincates its capabilities</li>
        <li>Receives requests from the hub and executes them</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Nodes</em> are different Selenium instances
        that will execute tests on individual computer systems.
        There can be many nodes in a grid.
        The machines which are nodes need do not need to be the same platform
        or have the same browser selection as that of the hub or the other nodes.
        A node on Windows might have the capability of
        offering Internet Explorer as a browser option,
        whereas this wouldn't be possible on Linux or Mac.

<div id="setup">
<h2>Setting up your own Selenium Grid</h2>
</div>

<p>To use Selenium Grid,
 you need to maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes.
 As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort,
 many organizations use IaaS providers
 such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute
 to provide this infrastructure.

<p>Other options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud.
 It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware.
 This chapter will go into detail about the option of running your own grid,
 complete with its own node infrastructure.


<h3>Quick start</h3>

<p>This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Grid Hub,
 and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node.
 We’ll also show you how to call the grid from Java.
 The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine,
 but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.

<p>The <em>selenium-server-standalone</em> package includes the hub,
 WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the grid.
 <em>ant</em> is not required anymore.
 You can download the <em>selenium-server-standalone-.jar</em> from
 <a href=http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/>http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/</a>.


<h4>Step 1: Start the hub</h4>

<p>The hub is the central point that will receive test requests
 and distribute them to the right nodes.
 The distribution is done on a capabilities basis,
 meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities
 will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.

<p>Because a test's desired capabilities are just what the name implies, <em>desired</em>,
 the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node
 fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.

<p>Open a command prompt
 and navigate to the directory where you copied
 the <em>selenium-server-standalone.jar</em> file.
 You start the hub by passing the <code>-role hub</code> flag
 to the standalone server:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub</code></pre>

<p>The hub will listen to port 4444 by default.
 You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to
 <a href=http://localhost:4444/grid/console>http://localhost:4444/grid/console</a>.

<p>To change the default port,
 you can add the optional <code>-port</code> flag
 with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command.
 Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below)
 are possible command-line flags.

<p>You certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above,
 but if you need more advanced configuration,
 then you may also for convenience specify a JSON format config file
 to configure the hub when you start it.
 You can do it like so:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug</code></pre>

<p>Below you will see an example of a <em>hubConfig.json</em> file.
 We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.

<pre><code class=json>{"_comment" : "Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json",
  "host": ip,
  "maxSession": 5,
  "port": 4444,
  "cleanupCycle": 5000,
  "timeout": 300000,
  "newSessionWaitTimeout": -1,
  "servlets": [],
  "prioritizer": null,
  "capabilityMatcher": "org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher",
  "throwOnCapabilityNotPresent": true,
  "nodePolling": 180000,
  "platform": "WINDOWS"}</code></pre>


<h4>Step 2: Start the nodes</h4>

<p>Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality,
 or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality,
 or both at the same time,
 you use the same <em>selenium-server-standalone.jar</em> file to start the nodes:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444</code></pre>

<p>If a port is not specified through the <code>-port</code> flag,
 a free port will be chosen. You can run multiple nodes on one machine
 but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory resources
 and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.


<h5>Configuration of node with options</h5>

<p>As mentioned, for backwards compatibility
 “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role.
 But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API,
 while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.

<p>Passing JVM properties (using the <code>-D</code> flag
 <em>before the -jar argument</em>)
 on the command line as well,
 and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:

<pre><code>-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe</code></pre>


<h5>Configuration of node with JSON</h5>

<p>You can also start grid nodes that are configured
 with a JSON configuration file

<pre><code>$ java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json</code></pre>

<p>And here is an example of a <em>nodeConfig.json</em> file:

<pre><code class=json>{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "browserName": "firefox",
      "acceptSslCerts": true,
      "javascriptEnabled": true,
      "takesScreenshot": false,
      "firefox_profile": "",
      "browser-version": "27",
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "maxInstances": 5,
      "firefox_binary": "",
      "cleanSession": true
    },
    {
      "browserName": "chrome",
      "maxInstances": 5,
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "webdriver.chrome.driver": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"
    },
    {
      "browserName": "internet explorer",
      "maxInstances": 1,
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "webdriver.ie.driver": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe"
    }
  ],
  "configuration": {
    "_comment" : "Configuration for Node",
    "cleanUpCycle": 2000,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "proxy": "org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy",
    "port": 5555,
    "host": ip,
    "register": true,
    "hubPort": 4444,
    "maxSession": 5
  }
}</code></pre>

<h5>A note about the <code>-host</code> flag</h5>

<p>For both hub and node, if the <code>-host</code> flag is not specified,
 <code>0.0.0.0</code> will be used by default. This will bind to all the
 public (non-loopback) IPv4 interfaces of the machine. If you have a special
 network configuration or any component that creates extra network interfaces,
 it is advised to set the <code>-host</code> flag with a value that allows the
 hub/node to be reachable from a different machine.

<h5>Specifying the Port</h5>

<p>The default TCP/IP port used by the hub is 4444. If you need to change the port please use above mentioned configurations</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<h5>Using Log file</h5>
<p> For advance troubleshooting you can specify log file to log system messeges.
For that start Selenium GRID hub or node with -log argument. Please see the below example
</p>
<pre><code>java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -log log.txt</code></pre>

<p>Use your favorite text editor to open log file (log.txt in above example) to find "ERROR" logs if you get issues</p>

<h5>Using -debug argument</h5>
<p> Also you can use -debug argument to print debug logs on console.
For that start Selenium GRID hub or node with -debug argument. Please see the below example
</p>
<pre><code>java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -debug</code></pre>


<h2>Docker Selenium</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> provides a convenient way to
  provision and scale Selenium Grid infrastructure in a unit known as a container.  Containers are standardised units of software that contain everything required
  to run the desired application including all dependencies in a reliable and repeatable
  way on different machines.

  The Selenium project maintains a set of Docker images which you can download
  and run to get a working grid up and running quickly.  Nodes are available for
  both Firefox and Chrome.  Full details of how to provision a grid can be found
  within the <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium">Docker Selenium</a>
  repository.

  <h3>Prerequisite</h3>
  <p>The only requirement to run a grid is to have Docker installed and working.

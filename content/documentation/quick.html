<p>Selenium is not just one tool or API
    but it composes many tools.


<h2>WebDriver</h2>

<p><em><a href="/documentation/wd">WebDriver</a></em> is also known as Selenium
    2. If you are beginning with desktop website test automation then you
    are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser
    automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and
    run tests. This is as if a real user is operating the browser. Since
    WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application
    code, it is not intrusive in nature. Hence, you are testing the
    same application which you push live.


<h2>Selenium Remote Control</h2>

<p><em><a href=rc.html>Selenium Remote Control</a></em> is also known
    as Selenium 1. Selenium RC was the most prominent Selenium tool
    before the advent of Selenium WebDriver. Selenium RC would use a
    proxy server and inject JavaScript into a browser to be able to control
    it. Given the intrusive nature Selenium RC had on a browser,
    you could never be sure if what you were testing was the same as
    the application you wanted to push live. Selenium 2 APIs yet contain Selenium RC APIs but
    Selenium 3 would completely get rid of Selenium RC APIs. If you are
    still using Selenium RC then you must
    <em><a href=rctowd.html>migrate</a></em> to Selenium WebDriver.


<h2>Selenium IDE</h2>

<p><em><a href=https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide>Selenium IDE</a></em> is a
    Firefox plugin which can be used to record test steps in Firefox itself.
    Selenium IDE can be used to generate <i>quick and dirty</i>
    test code in a variety of programming languages (i.e. C#,
    Java, Python, and Ruby). Given the maintainability of code generated
    through Selenium IDE, it is not recommended to use it for anything
    more than getting acquainted with element locators or generating
    <i>throw away code</i>. We're sure that once you get used to the
    WebDriver API, you will never use Selenium IDE.


<h2>Selenium Grid</h2>

<p> Soon after development of WebDriver tests, you may face a need of
    running your tests on multiple browser and operating system combinations.
    This is where <em><a href=grid.html>Selenium Grid</a></em>
    comes to the rescue.


<h2>Selenium HTML Runner</h2>

<p> This tool allows you to run Test Suites from the command
    line. Test Suites are HTML exports from Selenium IDE or campatible
    tools. <em><a href=html-runner.html>Selenium HTML-runner</a></em>
